FOREWORD
Like many people reading this book, I’ve spent much of my free time
playing games, watching anime, and reading comics. They’re all hobbies
I’ve been passionate about since I was a child, and they have not
become any less relevant to me in my adult life. I know that those
aren’t unusual claims, and I imagine that I’m probably not any more
invested in these hobbies as some of the other amazing community
members I’ve come to know during the creation of this book.
I say all that to let you know that I recognize and am incredibly
grateful for the opportunity I’ve been given with this project. Obojima
wasn’t something I ever thought I would be able to make, even after
starting a gaming company. It requires not only dozens of talented
individuals coming together to craft a book worth reading, but also the
support of a community, such as yourself, that is willing to give their
time, energy, and hard earned money to support a project that very well
could have sucked! (Lol, it doesn’t, I promise!)
I’m so appreciative for you giving me a chance to make something I’m
truly proud of.
Thank you all.
-Jeremiah Crofton

WELCOME TO THE
ISLAND OF OBOJIMA
If you are reading this, then welcome to the world of Obojima!
You’ve made it to this mysterious island where all manner of adventures await you. Whether you are
a player or a GM, we’re sure you will enjoy this setting that invites you to play in a world with a very
distinctive flavor. From spirit festivals to abandoned convenience stores, Obojima is sure to hold a
story worth telling. We hope as you explore the island, its people, and its mysteries that you are able
to experience DnD in a new and refreshing way.
Good luck, and may the wind find your sails.

How to Use the Book
Here are some guidelines and recommendations that we feel will give you the best
experience of playing or running a game in the world of Obojima.

Player and GM Facing Material

Live in the World

As with most sourcebooks that describe a world, there are
sections for all readers—players and Game Masters alike—
but in this book there are sections to be read only by the
Game Master. These sections for GM eyes only contain
secrets better left unread by players, sections such as the
three adventures that come with this book or the explanations of the great mysteries of Obojima. And so to ensure
your Obojima experience will be of the highest caliber,
we’ve color coded the book!

Before you roll up your first character, we invite you to live
in the world a little before you take the plunge and start
rolling the dice. Learn a bit about the island, read over some
of the locations, look at the art and allow your mind to
make up stories in your head. Absorb the backgrounds and
the factions sections to get a feel of what it’s like to be an
Obojiman out here on this idyllic, magic island filled with
spirits and mysteries.

Look For Blue
Titles, Headers, Tables, Boxes, and Glyphs that are colored
blue, are ways we’ve marked a section for GMs only. As a
player that’s glancing through the book, be on the lookout
for blue.

Other Books
If something is followed by an *, it means it’s an option
introduced in a book other than Obojima, such as the
5E Basic Rules.

If you’re used to playing or running games in DnD,
Obojima provides a potentially refreshing break into
another realm of storytelling and roleplaying. While fighting monsters and getting treasure can certainly be a part of
any Obojima adventure, figuring out relationships, discovering clues to solve weird mysteries, and parlaying with
elder spirits to appease their wrath are among some of the
less combat-centric and more roleplaying heavy aspects of
gaming in this world. And so, really immersing yourself
and becoming an Obojiman is something that we
highly recommend.

Readers should be on the lookout for our Notes
throughout the book. As writers we often leave
alternative interpretations, options, or notes on a
topic. These notes are completely optional,
so feel free to ignore them if you prefer the
standard writing.
So with that, we bid our noble Game Masters
happy storytelling! May you delight and surprise
your friends at the table of imagination. And to
our intrepid players may you enjoy boundless
adventures filled with wonder in the world
of Obojima!

-Adam, Ari, and Jeremiah

O

ABOUT THE WORLD

bojima is a world full of magic and spirits; where people live and explore, and where there are festivals for every occasion. Although life here is mostly idyllic with farmers tilling their fields and shepherds tending to their sheep dragons,
there is plenty of adventure to be had. Travelers will find their fair share of it by simply walking from village to village,
following rumors and spirit companions, and allowing the strange and wonderful tales of the tall grass to unfold.

Themes and Tone
Most tales told within Obojima are generally going to be
pleasant and relaxing experiences both for you and your
players—a journey into a realm of leisure fantasy where
time slows down and descriptions delight in the small
details: how the warm breeze blowing across the Gale Fields
dances on the skin, or the cozy comfort of sipping from a
hot cup of soup on a cool evening around a campfire with
companions. In Obojima, these small, sensory vignettes are
the biggest tool in a GM’s repertoire.
But that isn’t to say that everything in the world of
Obojima is pastoral and easy going. There are monsters and
plenty of peril here that the GM can use to turn a delightful
stroll through the countryside into a harrowing situation
where blades, bloodshed, and arcane magics are required.
These contrasting facets of Obojima make for compelling

2

storytelling as your moments of danger will feel that much
more dangerous and your moments of tranquility will feel
that much more earned.
Here are a few things to keep in mind as you create your
Obojima adventure:

Magic in the Mundane
An Obojima story is a journey into a world of wonder,
where innocence, laughter, and simple joys are just as
important as discovering magic, unraveling intrigues, and
exploring the mysteries of the island. Tales told here feel
small and contained, like getting to know every subtle
nuance, quirk, and charm of a village and the various characters who inhabit it. We invite you to slow down and tell
small stories here. Allow them to come to an end. Not every
adventure here needs to continue as a long, epic campaign.

Roleplaying Heavy
The conclusion to an adventure is that much sweeter when
the players are truly invested in the world around them,
one that you have filled with multifaceted characters who
bring your narrative to life. The stories that Obojima is best
suited for telling are stories that revolve around the unique
flavor of the world and the heartwarmingly odd people that
inhabit it. So we invite you to try out “character driven”
over “conflict driven” stories for your Obojima tales.
A conversation can be as fulfilling as combat!

Combat
Most situations on Obojima can usually be solved with
some smarts, a bit of tact, heaps of creativity, and a dose
of magic. There are conflicts and perils on the island to be
sure, but not every confrontation has to result in combat.
More often than not, combat can be averted with a
creative solution.
However, the further east you go, the more dangerous
the world becomes. Past the Gale Fields, being handy with a
blade is more and more a skill worth having. Even if one is
drawn into a conflict, it doesn’t always have to end in death;
there’s always pleading, parleying, and good old fashioned
fleeing. Creatures of all shapes and sizes tend to value their
life over being the victor of a combat.

Evil and Villainy
Evil does not have a strong presence on Obojima, generally,
creatures and monsters are forces of nature, motivated out
of natural fear or greed rather than of evil. Most villains are
comically ambitious, predictably greedy, or filled with obstinate conviction, but dig under the surface and they often
have the reasons for their actions rooted in a misguided
desire to do good. But that being said, there are evil forces
here, spirits that have been corrupted into demons who
seek unsettling ends; so there is a small pinch of the spice
of evil that you can certainly throw into any story soup you
simmer here on the shores of Obojima. For more information on crafting villains for an Obojima story, see page 267.

Island Magic
To completely immerse your game in the flavor of Obojima,
there are some spells in Dungeons & Dragons that do not
exist here, and there are some new spells that we have
created specifically for the world. The omission of these
spells helps to further immerse your players into the world
and the overall experience. For a full list of all the
spells both new and removed, see page 179.

To embrace the two-plane reality of Obojima, we
recommend having all plane-oriented spells such
as Plane Shift*, Contact Other Plane* and similar
type spells that involve a multiverse be limited to
only contacting the Spirit Realm.

Spirit Realm
Spirits are found all throughout Obojima, and they have
lived side by side with people for as long as anyone can
remember, but despite living here, they originate from a
mystical plane that is all their own—the Spirit Realm. The
Spirit Realm is a plane of eternal twilight that is overlaid on
top of Obojima; occupying the same space but existing and
operating beyond the ken of most physical beings. What
may appear to be an abandoned farmstead on the Physical
Realm might be a bustling marketplace in the Spirit Realm.
Most Obojimans know of the Spirit Realm, but few have
traveled to it. There are, however, those on the island who
know how to catch a glimpse of the Spirit Realm through
potions or special magics. There are some who even know
how to use these powers to enter it.

The Spirit Realm in Obojima is a replacement for
the Ethereal Plane and the Border Ethereal in
Dungeons & Dragons. The Physical Realm is the
Material Plane.

Entering the Spirit Realm
There are many ways to enter the Spirit Realm, but these
methods are by far the most common: through a portal,
casting a spell, catching the Wandering Line, drinking a
potion, or using a magic item.

Spirit Portals
Spirit portals are locations on the island where the veil that
keeps the Spirit and Physical Realms separated is stretched
thin enough to allow a traveler to pass between them.
These places are often areas of unearthly beauty or areas
where strange occurrences are rumored to have taken place.
For those that witness another pass through to the Spirit
Realm, they would see them fade out of existence, leaving
no trace of where they might have gone.

Stranger in a Strange Land
When you pass into the Spirit Realm, you remain a physical being and spirits can sense the material nature of you.
Spirits might remark that you “smell different” or are “abrasively loud”. Whatever the quirk is, they know that you are
not of this realm.

There are legendary places in the Spirit
Realm—bustling markets, floating shrines, ghost
ships, and megalithic temples. These locations
can be anywhere on Obojima, in the most remote
mountain regions or right next to a large village.
Because they’re invisible to anyone rooted in the
Physical Realm, most Obojimans have no idea
that these places exist, even though it may be
right under their noses.

Getting Out
Entering the Spirit Realm is one thing, but leaving it can
be quite another. Gates between worlds aren’t always open,
which means physical beings often need a plan B if the
passage they took into the Spirit Realm closes whilst
they’re visiting.

Spirits
Spirits on Obojima are magical entities that come in all
kinds of shapes and sizes and have lived among the islanders for centuries. Spirits are as much a part of Obojiman
society as all the other races, and it has been this way for as
long as anyone can remember.

Spirit Creature Types
In the world of Obojima, there are no other planes of existence other than the Spirit Realm and the Physical Realm,
and because of that, extraplanar creatures such as Fey,
Celestials, and Aberrations instead become the creature
type “spirit”. That also means that spells and other special
abilities that would affect those creature types affect the
“spirit” creature type instead.

Some spirits and some very special physical beings are
able to wander freely between both worlds taking whomever they like with them; however they often don’t work
for free, so you may need to strike a bargain to
gain their assistance.

Ghosts in Obojima

A Thin Veil

You could use the D&D ghost stat block for an undead
anomaly or a corrupted spirit (see “Corrupted Spirits’’ below).

Every now and then, activity from one
realm can be detected by the other. Spirits
in the Spirit Realm can sometimes sense
the living energy of a creature in the Physical
Realm, but they appear as vague, smudgy images.
Conversely, beings in the Physical Realm might experience
a movement out of the corner of their eye or hear a strange
knocking or scratching sound of a spirit that is nearby but
in the Spirit Realm.
For example, the laughter of a particularly raucous spirit
playing a nightly poker game in the Spirit Realm could keep
a nearby villager in the Physical Realm awake with their
haunting or annoying chuckles which can be heard across
the planes.

Spirit Time
As a general rule, time moves in the Spirit
Realm at a different rate—sometimes drastically—than on the Physical Realm. This is for
the GM to adjust to their liking.

Since there are no “souls” in the world of Obojima, there
are no ghosts as we know them. Obojimans use the word
“ghost” to refer to a spirit that never leaves the Spirit Realm
but occasionally can be sensed on the Physical Realm.

Many Kinds
There is a wide variety of spirits, from animalistic nature
spirits that run through forests and climb along mountain
ridges, to ancient and powerful elder spirits that guard sacred
groves and mountain tops. There are chatty intelligent spirits
who are shopkeepers and chefs, and there are non-sapient
spirits who are everything from adorable critters to naughty
pests. Unlike any other creature in the Physical Realm, spirits
encompass an incredibly vast and diverse range of roles in
the world. Because of this, material beings hold no universal opinion of them and it often boils down to a simpler
and more common thought process—if your actions are not
harmful, then you are respected and cared for.

Language of the Spirits
Although most spirits can speak Common, spirits have their
own language of Torum that is generally only heard in the
Spirit Realm.

5

Elder Spirits
There are ancient and powerful spirits known to inhabit
both the Spirit and Physical Realm. These elder spirits are
well known by those who live around them, evidenced by
the many shrines that lie at the foot of mountains and at
the shoreline of lakes and rivers to mark the entrance into
an elder spirit’s domain.
Elder spirits are often guardians of their domain—
protecting and caring for the land—but that’s not always
the case, as some are so otherworldly that all anyone can do
is guess as to their motives.

Meeting an Elder Spirit
Encountering an elder spirit is a quest in itself. Not all elder
spirits want to be contacted, and even if they did, most
aren’t easily found. Many elder spirits are not interested in
humans, and some may even kill humans the way a wild
animal might if threatened. If the proper care is taken, elder
spirits may tolerate the presence of a non-spirit being, and
those that can understand language may even converse.
Meeting an elder spirit is an extreme experience. For
some, it is like meeting a force of nature, a paragon of
beasts, the wildness of a river, or the soul of a mountain.
For other types it could be speaking to the voice of the
wind, witnessing the unfolding of a cosmic flower, or hearing legends from an ancient oak tree.
The lore of Obojima talks about elder spirits knowing
magic, myths, and mysteries and the many who have sought
their wisdom, their knowledge, or their heads. These stories
of adventuring into the realm of an elder spirit are repeated
in children’s tales, around campfires, and in taverns late at
night. Some tales are terrifying, while others are stories of
strange beauty and otherworldly journeys, but every time
an adventurer has met with an elder spirit, it has assuredly
been a tale worth retelling.

Demons
As you already know, in the world of Obojima, there are no
other planes of existence other than the Spirit Realm and
the Physical Realm, and because of that, certain extraplanar
creature types have been changed to the “spirit” creature
type. This is not the case for the fiends. Although fiends
are just as wicked on Obojima as their standard fantasy
counterparts, they no longer spawn from fiery hellscapes
nor battle angelic warriors.

When a spirit becomes a demon, they lose their affinity
with the Spirit Realm. Crossing over to their realm of origin
becomes almost impossible, as the realm itself is revolting
to them.

Corrupted Spirits
Spirits that have somehow become tainted by the Corruption
(see page 16 for more information about the Corruption) are
forced into the demon transformation. This process can
happen in a matter of hours, days, or weeks depending on
the strength of the spirit and the amount of interaction
they had with the Corruption. Over that time, the spirit is
painfully transformed in shape and demeanor which can
range from enraged to scared to diabolical, while others
might experience desperation or confusion, and wish to
return to normal.

Cosmology
Obojima is a two-plane world—the Physical Realm and
the Spirit Realm. All other planes do not exist in this
universe. There are no gods per se, but there are elder spirits and great beasts that are revered and respected among
Obojimans. Other powerful spirits can become patrons
of warlocks, sharing pieces of their own power. They can
become an inspiration to a paladin or cleric who, through
their own faith and practice, can work wonders of magic
inspired by the concepts these spirits embody.
Although there are many spirits worthy of respect and
even fear, it is the island itself—Obojima—that is honored
more than any single spirit on the island. Most inhabitants of Obojima rely on the land, and because of this, they
generally give a nod of gratitude toward the island during
a bountiful harvest or at the completion of a safe trip,
but that doesn’t mean that everyone feels the same way.
Some Obojimans don’t give two hoots about great beasts
or the land’s will and think that all these offerings and
shrines don’t amount to a hill of zelk beans. On the whole,
Obojimans are not an overly religious lot and are more
interested in a hot bowl of soup and listening to good music
in a comfy tavern with some friends than bothering some
powerful being with their endless appeals.

In Obojima, the fiend creature type embodies a spirit that
has undergone a sinful transformation. These spirits are
so filled with malice and devoid of love, that their bodies
become too weak to hold the wickedness festering inside
itself; it is cursed to transform, taking on a twisted caricature of itself, far removed from any of its original beauty.
Spirits transformed in this way are called “demons”.

T

THE ISLAND

o the people who live here, the world begins and ends at the shore. The ocean surrounds Obojima, stretching out to the
horizon in all directions. The island, the ocean, and the sky are all there is. What does this mean for Obojimans?
This chapter explores what life is like on the island. It contains an overview of the island’s history, culture, and geography, as well as a breakdown of the island’s currency. You will also find descriptions of factions—organizations that are active
across Obojima.

How Obojimans Live
Obojima is small enough that a general island culture has
developed over the centuries. It’s predominantly a mix of
Nakudama and human root cultures but has since developed into something that transcends race and region. Spirits, magic, and gadgetry from the island’s distant past all
have a place in Obojiman culture. Each settlement has its
own character, with quirks, nuances, and traditions of their
own, but they are not so removed from the wider culture
that they would be considered something wholly different.

defense. It also means adventurers are frequently called
upon to ensure a settlement’s safety.

With few exceptions, Obojimans live in villages and small
towns scattered across the island. No monarch or governing
body claims rulership of the island. Instead, governance is
left to the individual settlements. Some look to elders or
elect mayors to lead them. Others form affiliations with
other settlements to form a cooperative league—a common
practice in the region known as the Gift of Shuritashi.

Beyond the Island

However they are governed, most Obojimans get by as
farmers or fisherfolk. Other common trades and professions
include artisans, merchants, specialty chefs, and potion
crafters. Specialties vary by region and village.

This is how Obojimans see their island’s place in their
watery world—they are an island unto themselves. Every
time an intrepid soul gets the itch to see beyond the horizon for themselves, this worldview is reinforced because
those who leave don’t return.

The general independence of settlements means each one
is also responsible for defending itself. Larger towns might
have a town guard, while smaller settlements might rely on
a militia or even a solitary local champion to come to their

Life’s Big Questions
Perhaps no other factor shapes the typical Obojiman worldview more than the fact that their entire world is made up
of the island.

Walk to the water’s edge. Stick your toes in the sand. Now
look out across the ocean. Nothing but the glistening sea.
Do this again wherever the island meets the sea and the
result will be the same. There is Obojima and then there is
the vastness of the endless ocean. What else is there?

That doesn’t mean there is no speculation or fantasizing about what might be hiding just out of view. In fact,
“Beyond the Island” is a favorite storytelling game among

tavern goers. In the game, players weave a fantastical tale
about something that exists beyond the island. Each player
builds on the previous player’s idea until they’re left with a
truly outlandish story.

have left their plane of origin—some may prefer the bustle
and sensations of the Physical Realm while others may
live here because they cannot go back, perhaps due to a
magic curse, having spent too long on the Physical Realm,
or being corrupted.

Regarding Spirits

Wanderers. Spirits who can travel freely back and forth
between the Physical Realm and the Spirit Realm are known
as Wanderers by Obojimans. These spirits often work as
guides, messengers, and merchants who deal in goods from
both realms, but there are some who are not to be trusted
and seek to exploit the foolish and naive.

The people of Obojima coexist with spirits, which occupy
a unique position in Obojiman society. People respect and
even revere certain spirits, while other spirits live among
their corporeal counterparts as residents in villages and
towns. Some spirits are even regarded as pests or nuisances.
Whatever the case may be, spirits are part of everyday life.
That’s not to say that spirits and the Spirit Realm are
mundane. It’s more that the people of Obojima have
resigned themselves to never fully understanding their
mysterious manner. It’s simply another quirk in their
charming world.
Certain spirit behaviors have led Obojimans to at least
place spirits into one of three categories that reflect their
relationship with the Physical Realm. The three types are:
spirits who live in the Physical Realm, spirits who wander
back and forth between the realms, and spirits that live
exclusively in the Spirit Realm. To non-spirit Obojimans
they are known colloquially as Homebodies, Wanderers,
and Ghosts.
Homebodies. Spirits that live in the Physical Realm are
called Homebodies by the locals as they prefer to live and
work among Obojimans rather than among other spirits in
the Spirit Realm. There are many reasons why these spirits

Ghosts. Spirits who have, for various reasons, never set foot
in the Physical Realm and are bound to the Spirit Realm
are known as “Ghosts”. In fact, Obojimans will often say if
someone has a noisy spirit that they “have a ghost”, as some
spirits can make such a ruckus that even in the Spirit Realm
they can be heard in the Physical Realm.

Spirits who can move back and forth freely
between the planes are a fun plot device to tell
some interesting stories. A spirit intermediary is
a useful NPC as they can negotiate deals and give
quests between the Physical and Spirit Realms.
Spirit go-betweens can set up adventures where
the party is called on to help the spirits, or if the
adventurers get trapped in the Spirit Realm,
they can help guide them.

Everyday Magic
Magic permeates Obojima, and not just in the sense that
the island is magical—which it is. It’s also part of the daily
lives of Obojimans. Various traditions of folk magic, academy wizardry, and trade secrets of the witch covens are all
part of the magic that people employ to make their lives
easier. Most folks are not gifted in the magical arts, but
those who are often find places in settlements to offer their
services to the locals.
Potions, in particular, are always in demand. The “work
smarter not harder” minded farmer might use a Potion
of Rabbit’s Speed to finish the harvest. Or a traveling
merchant whose cart broke a wheel could reach for a
Potion of Liquid Mending to quickly make a repair. This
kind of common magic is not something Obojimans fear or
mistrust, in fact, new magical breakthroughs are more often
than not greeted with curiosity and excitement.
Then there’s the magic that can dazzle and awe. Spirits
and powerful spellcasters can tap into arcane energy that
is beyond the ordinary and mundane, revealing a peek into
the unseen sea of magic that roils all across Obojima.

Beliefs About Death
Beliefs about death are as varied as Obojimans themselves.
An adventurer who roams the island and studies the different locations will find that where an Obojiman lives effects
what they believe and shapes their view of what happens
after death. When an Obojiman passes away, they might
hear someone in a coastal village say they’ve gone “beyond
the horizon” or a farmer in the Gale Fields say that they
have “returned to the island.” There are many on the island
who believe that everyone’s essence is magic, the same
power that can shake the earth, conjure flame, or heal a
wound, is the same power that puts the light of consciousness in every being.
For the most part, Obojimans don’t really think that
much about death as they are largely focused on living each
day to the fullest. An adventurer will often find Obojimans
working, playing, loafing, and singing during the day then,
as the sun begins to set, they all come into the village to
enjoy the comforts of the community with music, food,
drink, and tall tales.
When death does come for one of the villagers, it is a
bittersweet moment. Many approach death with curiosity
and wonder, for to reunite with the magic and mystery of
Obojima is the greatest of blessings. Because of this, an
Obojiman funeral is often both a celebration and a sorrow.
Depending on where they live, Obojimans may bury their
departed in the earth, burn them on a pyre, immerse them
in the ocean, or leave them on a hilltop—in all cases, the
belief is that Obojima will reclaim its children and take
them back into its heart, perhaps even to return again in
some other form.

10

Currency
Though bartering is commonplace, particularly in the rural
reaches of the island, most Obojimans accept a standard
coinage that is minted by sages of the Dawn Blossom Guild.
The currency has three denominations: gold flower, sea
petal, and copper bud. Colloquially, they are just called flowers, petals, and buds.
All coins produced by the Dawn Blossom Guild are
infused with a magical energy that the sages channel into
them. To these secretive sages, the exchange of money
is an exchange of energy—it’s a critical transaction that
keeps energy flowing through the island. The clink of guild
minted coins is a sound that is pleasing to the ear. Coins
that were not created by the Dawn Blossom Guild or those
that lost the magic within them sound dead by contrast.
Therefore, most people only accept what are deemed
true coins—those minted by the Dawn Blossom Guild—
as currency.

Copper Bud
A bud is a small, oblong ingot of
copper etched to look like a dawn
blossom flower yet to bloom. 100
copper buds are equal to the value of
1 gold flower.

Sea Petal
Sea petals are unique in that they are
not made of metal at all. Instead, they
are made of glass that is formed to
resemble the petals of a dawn blossom flower. The technique the sages
use to craft petals is a closely guarded
secret, but what is known is that a
specific kind of sand found on Obojima’s shores is used. 10 sea petals are
equal to the value of 1 gold flower.

Gold Flower
Both faces of these large gold disks
are embossed with the likeness of a
dawn blossom flower in full bloom.
A “flower” plunked down on a tavern
table is an unmistakable sound.

Because of their spiritual essence, gold flower coins are real
in both realms, and spirits will readily trade in gold for
goods and services, though there are some spirits that are
less interested in precious metals and more interested in
bartering for goods brought from the Physical Realm.

Languages
The common language of Obojima is based primarily on
the one brought by the humans, though it also contains a
smattering of the Nakudama language, Naku Naku. Most
Nakudama continue to speak their original language as well
as the common tongue, and they claim theirs is far richer
for the telling of tales.
Torum is the favored language of the Spirit Realm.
Though non-spirits can learn to understand it, beings of
the Physical Realm often can’t make the layered sounds
required to voice the words.
The objects and structures from the island’s earliest age
contain a variety of written languages known to the islanders as First Age languages. Other than the academics who
devote themselves to studying these mysterious languages,
people generally know only a handful of words.

History
The history of Obojima is best understood as a series
of eras, each one named for the people who arrived at
that era’s start. The only exception to this rule is the era
of prehistory, known simply as the First Age, which
encompasses all Obojiman history until the arrival of the
Nakudama. Discussions of the First Age refer mostly to
one of two topics—the peculiar technology scattered across
Obojima and the spirits of the island, who may have always
been part of it.
The second age, which stretches back into myth, is the
Nakudama Age. Whether we are to believe the myths
about how the Nakudama queen traveled across the vast
ocean to land upon the shores of the island is not as
important as understanding that the Nakudama have inhabited Obojima for generations beyond count.
The Nakudama Age gave way to the Age of Humanity
1200 years ago, when the first humans—seafaring people—
found their way to the island. Humans and Nakudama
quickly took to one another, establishing many joint settlements that continue to thrive today. This era also saw the
first elves born among humans.
The current era began 300 years ago, when the dara first
emerged from the forest. It has therefore been dubbed the
Dara Age. However, the coming of what has been called the
Corruption may yet herald a new era altogether.

Age of Unknown. Little is known about the time before
the Nakudama. Scholars speculate that there was once a
people who created the wonders of the First Age, but there
is no understanding of how they came to be or where
they’ve gone.
Arrival of the Nakudama. Nakudama history states
that the first Queen of the Nakudama swam across the
great ocean to land on the shores of Obojima. It was on
those shores that she birthed the first 100 Nakudama and
founded her kingdom.
Founded the capital city of Lilywin. Very little archaeological evidence has been found of the great Nakudama
city, but historical texts state that Lilywin once stretched
across miles and miles of the Gale Fields. Some scholars and

historians believe that the roads and trails commonly used
in the Gales Fields today could have origins rooted in the
city of Lilywin.
Ascent of Oghmai, the demon usurper. The fall of the
Nakudama kingdom came at the hand of a powerful demon
known as Oghmai. Through Oghmai’s manipulation, two
factions formed among the Nakudama people, hatred grew
among them, and an inevitable war would later devastate
the countryside. Oghmai took the opportunity to seize the
throne, which began his brief but brutal reign.
Monarchy dissolves. Despite Oghmai’s cruelty, resistance was never fully extinguished, and before long, the
Nakudama rose up against the demon and his armies.

Oghmai was deposed and imprisoned, but the kingdom was
left in shambles.
Rather than rebuilding, the remaining Nakudama, led by a
sage known as Shalwin, chose to disband the monarchy and
rebuild a new society in the areas unchanged by the war.
Arrival of the humans. It is said that the first humans
arrived by boat, but no record shows from where they
traveled. What scholars do know is that the Nakudama
historical texts state that the humans carried with them a
greater understanding of the First Age—far beyond what
Nakudama scholars had ever understood.
First elves are born. As a gift to the people of Okiri, an
elder spirit blessed the bloodline of humans that lived there

so that their children and their children’s children would
every so often give birth to an elf—beings connected to the
Spirit Realm and bearing marks of power. Since the advent
of this blessing however, the frequency of elven births are
less and less.
Vanishing Mountain first sighted. The first sighting of
the Vanishing Mountain came with much excitement. The
idea of a mountain that appears and disappears on the horizon would go on to spur a generation of sailors and explorers who ventured out and never returned.
Earthquake & Tsunami shake the island. A destructive
earthquake and tsunami rattled the island and its people,
causing mass damage across many regions and nearly
destroying the town of Polewater.

Technology
On Obojima the most advanced technology is also its oldest.
For as long as anyone can remember, and even as far as
historians can discern, the island has always been home
to this peculiar category of technology. Instead of being an
oddity, however, the islanders have embraced what they call
First Age relics and integrated them into their society so
that Obojima today is a mix of vaguely medieval and near
modern technology.
The adoption of relics from the First Age into the everyday
lives of Obojimans is one of the things that gives this setting
its unique flavor. A wizard with headphones might cast
spells from a cassette instead of a spellbook. A vending
machine at a dangerous crossroads might provide a desperately needed healing potion to an injured traveler. A floppy
disk might be the key to a hidden vault. First Age relics don’t
have to be fully understood in order to be fully embraced.

Here are some examples of how this technology has been
incorporated into Obojiman society:
Vending Machines. Obojima is full of wonders and oddities of every shape and size, but few are as numerous as the
vending machines littered throughout the island. Most of
these relics of metal and glass from the First Age stand as
part of the landscape like any other rock or shrub. But many
have been given renewed purpose. By means of magical
enchantment, these once abandoned vending machines are
operational again, but with magical trinkets on display. The
trend is so widespread that it’s safe to assume a machine
found in decent condition is already claimed by a young
wizard making plans to turn it into their own magical shop.
Over the years, many boastful wizards and witches alike
have claimed the idea to enchant vending machines was
theirs, but that’s an argument best left to historians.

Spirits, Magic, and Tech

Leaving dozens of magical whatnots on display amongst
the wilds of Obojima certainly has its risks. For every
talented mage that enchants a vending machine, two
talented thieves are plotting to steal the vulnerable goods.
This is why most vending machines are protected by a
guardian in the proprietor’s absence. Guardians are often
spirits, monsters, or another willing person who has
entered a deal with the wizard. Of late, awakened cats have
become the guardian of choice.

Many relics from the First Age require power to run. Without gasoline, batteries, or outlets, Obojimans have had to
find other ingenious methods to get them powered up.
Certain spirits possess the ability to function like batteries
or as a source of fuel known as “whelming”, and they are
happy to lend their services for the right price. Alternatively,
Obojimans can turn to magic. At some point in the island’s
long history, wizards discovered the spell, Jolt, which can be
used to power devices.

Cartridges, Cassettes, and VHS. Once the curious, crinkly
black ribbon was first unspooled from the plastic casing
of a cassette, it didn’t take long for sages to uncover it
contained hidden messages—singing voices and music
somehow contained within, and revealed only through the
use of a cassette player. The same was true of the cassette’s
larger cousins, the odd black blocks labeled VHS, only these
contained images too. These objects, which seemed to reveal
a world from beyond, captivated sages.

That’s not to say that the mystery of the First Age is
ignored. There are those who devote themselves to studying
it, but technology has been part of island life for so long
that it is just a part of their world.

First Age Technology Conditions
Working Condition: The machine can be powered by a
spirit or the Jolt spell.
Damaged: The machine won’t work if whelmed by a spirit
or targeted by the Jolt spell, but could be fixed by making the
appropriate skill checks.
Sundered: The machine is damaged beyond repair. It’s time
to scrap it for parts.

Real-World Comparison. First Age technology
describes the real world era of, roughly, the 1980s.
It’s when analog tech was in the process of transitioning to digital. It’s the era of cassette players
and 8-bit video games. There are clunky computers, VCRs, action figures, and even automobiles.
This is a pre-cell phone world.
On Guns. For the purest Obojima flavor, we
suggest leaving guns out, despite them existing
alongside the technology described in this section.
As always, it’s up to you.

Tapes were among the first objects from the First Age
to be adopted by spellcasters when they learned to imbue
tape with their own magic. This became incredibly popular amongst witches and wizards who would use the odd
trinkets as spell scrolls. When portable cassette players were
discovered, wizards quickly adopted them too, replacing
their spellbooks with an array of cassettes.
Instaprint Cameras. A favorite among the First Age gadgets
that are found on the island is the camera, particularly
instaprint cameras, which miraculously spit out a small card
that reveals the captured image after a few moments, with
the help of vigorous shaking. In addition to the (almost)
instant gratification, it was discovered that the film cards
these cameras use are sensitive to magic, which shows up
as an aura in pictures. It was through the playful use of an
instaprint camera that a family in Okiri Village discovered
that their heirloom ladle was, in fact, enchanted with a
powerful curse that soured every soup it touched.
Original packs of film cards are hard to come by these
days, but savvy alchemists have recently found a way to
make new ones using silver dust and a bit of magic.

The Corruption
Obojimans have noticed some odd things over the years,
and being Obojimans, they take it all in stride. But since the
great earthquake and tsunami three months ago, there has
been more chatter than usual. There’s the typical grumbling among farmers, ever concerned about the well-being
of their crops and the worried talk from merchants about
their wagons being slowed down by the whims of the
island spirits. But there’s more serious talk that has been
drifting in from the far side of Obojima, the eastern side,
where rumors and strange tales of a growing Corruption are
beginning to spread across the island and get whispered by
patrons in taverns and by travelers who cross paths
on trails.
The odd and the mysterious are nothing new to
Obojimans, so hearing about a weird patch of magic grass
that hampers travel across the Gale Fields or an upwelling
of bubbling pools of random goo that suddenly appears in
a farming village, are something that Obojimans have dealt

with on several occasions. Obojima is, after all, a land where
spirits and magic are intertwined with daily life.
But there’s a sense of worry about this particular anomaly. Perhaps it was because the Corruption was heralded
first by an earthquake that shook the entire island, and
then was followed by a tidal wave that caused the villagers
on the eastern shores to run for the high ground. These
events and the ensuing encroachment of this supernatural Corruption has the residents of the eastern side of the
island quite alarmed.
For those who have seen the Corruption zones with their
own eyes, it is their testimony alone that is helping to
spread the news westward. But Obojimans are not wanderers by nature, so news is traveling slowly. The eastern witch
covens are reacting to its presence with a mixture of arcane
fascination, metaphysical concern, and, of course, devious witchery, and many of them are spending their time
sampling the Corruption and exploring its magical implications and arcane efficacy in their potions and brews.

Factions

Mariners’ Guild

This section describes organizations that have a presence
throughout Obojima. Over the course of a campaign, characters could become affiliated with one or more of them. Or,
characters who run afoul of a faction might find they have
created a whole slew of enemies.

UNDERSEA EXPLORERS

AHA
ACADEMIC ADVENTURERS
Much of the Obojima’s past may be
unknown, but the guild of archaeologists, historians, and archivists known as AHA believe it is
not unknowable. From their observatory headquarters in
the Coastal Highlands, AHA oversees a collection of field
research teams scattered throughout the island at no less
than a dozen ruins and excavation sites.
AHA is directed by a trio of academics—one drawn from
each of the guild’s three traditions. Collectively, they are
known as the Asloh. The trio is made up of an archaeologist
known as Gurriko, a female Nakudama interested primarily
in the ancient building techniques of her people; Loninni,
a female human and historian from the foothills of Mount
Arbora; and finally, a towering male blue dara named Uba,
who serves as the guild’s chief archivist.
The nature of AHA’s work takes its research teams to
some of the most perilous and wild parts of the island, so
they are always in need of intrepid research assistants and
armed escorts.

Courier Brigade
KNIGHTS OF THE
POSTAL SERVICE
“Deliverance through delivery.” This is
the code of the Courier Brigade, an order
of postal knights devoted to the safe delivery of parcels all
across Obojima, no matter how dangerous the trip or remote
the destination. Most of the time, couriers deliver packages,
but they also serve as escorts for travelers. Most couriers
prefer large flightless birds as mounts, though this is not a
requirement of the brigade’s regulations.
Most settlements have parcel boxes that fall under the
jurisdiction of a courier, and the larger towns have brigade
halls, where squads of couriers reside.
The brigade also maintains a string of forts that protect
important crossroads, including the formidable Fort Harglo
in the Gale Fields. Here, Postmaster General Escalante
oversees the brigade’s operations and personally leads a
small group of elite knights who are dispatched to relieve
imperiled couriers.

Thirty years ago, enthusiasts of the world
beneath the waves formed the Mariners’
Guild to support submarine exploration.
Under the leadership of its founder,
Captain Clintock, the guild established four lodges—one at
each of the islands’ cardinal directions. These lodges serve
as both home and workshop for the divers of the guild,
each equipped with a small boatyard and launch, where
members can test their latest seagoing vessels.
After an initial boom in popularity, the guild’s membership has diminished over the decades. Of the four lodges,
only the north and south ones remain in use, with Captain
Clintock’s two daughters, Holly and Paloma, operating out
of them respectively. The captain only rarely comes ashore,
preferring to remain aboard the Pointue, his famous swordfish submersible.
Of late, Captain Clintock, his daughters, and the remaining members of the Mariners’ Guild have all been working
diligently to figure out how to fight back the Corruption that
has emerged on the eastern side of the island. Most of their
recent studies are regarding the Corruption’s effects on the
marine flora and fauna. In an expedition to the corrupted
coastline, the captain’s sub was damaged. His efforts to get
to his daughter, Holly, a gifted engineer who could repair
the Pointue, have been thwarted by the Lionfish King.

Society of
Young Stewards
YOUTH SCOUTS
Youths all across Obojima are members of their local chapter
of the Society of Young Stewards, an organization dedicated to teaching stewardship of nature and general good
citizenship. Young stewards earn special badges that mark
particular achievements or masteries, such as whittling,
making campfires, or demonstrating the best way to calm
an angry hill dragon.
Chapter leaders hold ceremonies to honor exceptional
service, acts of kindness, and other achievements that
exemplify what it means to be a steward. As the saying goes,
“Once a steward, always a steward.” Stewards have all kinds
of ways that they help the community and the island, and
there’s been more than one example of a steward finding an
ingenious way to save the harvest, cross a flooded river, or
help a lost flock of goats get back to the safety of their barn.
The wilderness is a steward’s second home. That means it’s
not uncommon for steward camping trips to become imperiled by one of the many dangers the island has to offer. Howlers might descend on a camp, or the stewards might wake to
find themselves in the middle of the Wandering Forest. In
such cases, adventurers often muster to come to their rescue.

Sword Schools
RIVAL MASTERS OF
THE BLADE
Obojima boasts a proud tradition of
swordplay—several, actually. Each sword
tradition has two masters of equal rank who oversee a
school and take on worthy pupils to share the secrets of
their craft.
Students who train at a sword school earn the opportunity to train alongside, and eventually test their skills
against, one of the masters in a duel. These tests are most
commonly first to touch, where the combatants use blunted
blades to see who can land a blow first. The reward for
scoring a touch against a master is something truly
special—the opportunity to learn that school’s signature
master technique.
The schools are named after the founding masters. Here
is a list of the current schools and their locations.
◊ Canden and Moon is located in Yatamon in the south of
the Gift of Shuritashi.
◊ Lom and Salt is located on the northern slope of Mount
Arbora close to the summit.
◊ Tellu and Scale is located in the Gift of Shuritashi’s
northern coast.
◊ Toraf and Boulder is located in the middle of a waterlogged plain in the Brackwater Wetlands.

18

Becoming a Pupil
There are two common ways to gain admittance to one of
the sword schools. The first is by invitation. Sword masters
are always on the lookout for prospective pupils, so folks
who have earned a reputation as a sword talent through
their exploits are likely to garner attention from one or
more of the schools. It’s not uncommon for a talented
candidate to be given multiple invites to attend two or
more of the schools. Alternatively, a warrior can earn their
way into a school by proving their skill and challenging a
designated champion to a nonlethal duel. At the champion’s
discretion, they will gift a challenger with a signet, which
can then be presented to any master that recognizes the
champion at their school.

Training
Students train at a school for as long as they like. Some stay
for a season, while others have become permanent fixtures
and masters in their own right. During their training they’ll
live alongside other pupils and work to maintain the school.
Students who wish to train for longer periods can even be
assigned quests and simple tasks, which they oversee and
complete as representatives of the school. These quests are
often charitable acts the school has chosen to take on and
can take as little as a day to complete or stretch as long as a
year’s time.

The Duel
When a pupil believes they are ready to learn a school’s
master technique, they can ask to challenge one of the
masters during one of the testing periods, which occur
4 times a year. The test is a duel with blunted swords.
To prove they are ready, the pupil must land a hit on the
master in three rounds without the use of magic. Those
who succeed are given the opportunity to learn the school’s
master technique. Those who fail must wait three months
for the next testing opportunity.

A master’s AC starts at 30. For each week or
month (your choice) the pupil has trained at that
school, the master’s AC drops by 1. For example,
if a pupil has studied at the school for five weeks,
the master’s AC drops from 30 to 25 for the
purpose of the duel.

Witches and Covens
WITCHES BOUND TO EACH
OTHER BY OATHS
Need to diagnose a curse? Are you looking
for ingredients to brew a potion? Do you
want to learn for yourself the magical
secrets Obojima keeps hidden from those
who don’t know where to look? If the answer is yes to any
of these questions, you’re likely seeking a witch. Witches
are found all over the island. They are found operating out
of settlements as resident magic specialists or in wilderness
dwellings and strongholds where they develop their craft
away from the prying eyes of jealous rivals.
Most witches are linked to a coven—a group of witches
sworn to aid the other members and share their arcane
secrets with each other. Other witches remain solitary,
preferring to stay out of inter-coven feuds. That doesn’t
mean that covens won’t try to recruit them, or at least exert
influence over them.
Covens are always on the lookout for apprentices worthy
of their unique tradition of magic. Individual witches, with
the right kind of convincing, might agree to take on an
apprentice as well.

Joining a Coven
The decision to join a coven is no small thing. Typically,
young mages apprentice with a coven witch for a time
before being asked to join. Others are talented witches who
practice on their own and are then recruited directly into a
coven’s ranks. In either case, when a new witch is chosen
for potential membership, it is the coven who ultimately
decides whether or not to extend an invitation to join.
For a witch to be admitted into a coven, they must
take the coven’s oath. This is a special ritual that binds
that witch to the coven and in return the coven becomes
bound to the witch. Those who take the oath become fully
inducted into that coven’s ways. They gain access to the
power and magical traditions at the coven’s disposal, and

they gain the protection of their covenmates against threats
both arcane and mundane. Some covens offer witches a
place to stay and practice magic, though many witches
prefer to keep their own dwellings.
A witch who breaks a coven oath suffers a curse that
manifests physically to mark the oathbreaker. The nature of
the curse varies by coven.

Fish Head Coven
From their domain in the Gale Fields, the witches of the
ascendant Fish Head Coven spread their arcane influence
across the island to control the discovery and trade of magical ingredients, to feed their insatiable obsession with their
art. Dozens of witches on the island are affiliated with the
Fish Head Coven, answering to the whims of the coven’s
ruling Council of Three and Thirty, an arrangement that
smaller covens envy or bemoan.

Other Covens
Though the Fish Head Coven wields the most influence,
there’s still enough room on Obojima for a handful of other
covens, with lairs of their own. Inter-coven hostilities are
usually kept to a sportsmanlike rivalry, but feuds bubble up
from time to time, and some even result in duels.
Other notable covens include:
◊ Cloud Cap Coven at the base of Mount Arbora
◊ Patchwork Robe Coven in the Land of Hot Water
◊ The Tall Hats who wander in their caravan primarily in
the Gift of Shuritashi
◊ Crowsworn in the Brackwater Wetlands
◊ League of the Gilded Gourd in the Coastal Highlands

Getting Around the
Island
Walking is a common enough way to travel the roads that
crisscross Obojima, but there are plenty of other ways if
you’d like to give your feet a rest. Many Obojimans travel
by mount or in the back of a cart or wagon. The islanders
rely on a wide variety of creatures to handle this. Horses
and bestial spirits are the most prevalent, but you will find
sturdy goats on the slopes of Mount Arbora, thick-scaled
reptiles in the Gale Fields, and even the occasional
giant dragonfly.

Regions
Most maps of Obojima divide the island into six regions
that are widely recognized by the islanders. The regions
are not political divisions, but rather, they describe larger
geographical areas that share certain characteristics. A
seventh region describes the submerged landscape that
surrounds the island. It is known as the Shallows. Beyond
the shelf of the Shallows is the vast expanse of ocean that
the islanders refer to as the Deep.

The Gift of Shuritashi

Some folks prefer vehicles to get around. Hot air balloons
and gliders are common sights. Relics from the First Age also
provide even more options, which include bicycles, motorbikes, and scooters. Even cars and trucks are not so rare
that they would be met with disbelief on the road. For more
information on vehicles, see page 161.

Also known as the Gift, the westernmost and largest region
is named after a great spirit that once roamed the western forests of the island. The land is a patchwork of idyllic
landscapes that include rolling hills, lush forests, and sandy
beaches. Most of its scattered villages and towns are home
to farmers and craftspeople.

The most truly wondrous mode of transportation is via
the Wandering Line, a train that makes stops all over the
island, including several in the Spirit Realm. For more information on the Wandering Line, see page 113.

For more on the Gift of Shuritashi and the locations in it,
see page 23.

No matter the method you choose to travel, you’ll surely
have quite the adventure on your hands. There is almost 300
miles between the quaint western coastline to the dangerous
eastern beaches, most of which are uninhabited wilds.

The Land of Hot Water
Natural hot springs dot an otherwise arid landscape that
stretches between the northern slope of Mount Arbora
and the sea. The people who live here enjoy a culture that
balances industry and relaxation. Of late, a fad of flight has
spread among the engineers and tinkerers who live here.
For more on the Land of Hot Water and the locations in
it, see page 48.

20

Mount Arbora
The looming peak of this ancient mountain can be seen
from every corner of Obojima. Meltwater from its snowy
slopes feed the island’s rivers, so some of the island’s
residents regard Mount Arbora as Obojima’s beating
heart. Though majestic, the mountain is treacherous. The
terrain can be unforgiving, and some of the island’s largest
monsters dwell here.
For more on Mount Arbora and the locations in it, see
page 64.

The Gale Fields
The center of the island is a vast, sweeping plain—a wilderness of uncommonly tall grass. Crossing the Gale Fields
is no easy task, but it’s the quickest way to travel from
one end of the island to the other. The honorable Courier
Brigade maintains the major roads that crisscross the Gale
Fields, though the nomadic communities who call the area
home know its secret paths for good reason: this is the
domain of the howlers.
For more on the Gale Fields and the locations in it, see
page 74.

The Brackwater Wetlands
Aside from the peak of Mount Arbora, the soggy Brackwater Wetlands in the east of Obojima are the island’s most
sparsely populated region. The people here are accustomed
to a hardscrabble life, and they have adapted to the swamp
by building entire settlements on stilts. The region is
known for its time honored tradition of mud eel fishing,
though its greatest point of pride is that it is the home of

the island-famous Hakumon’s Ramen Shop. Of late, the
treacherous wetlands have become even more dangerous,
as a large swathe of it has been overrun by the mysterious
Corruption that came from the sea only months ago.
For more on the Brackwater Wetlands and the locations
in it, see page 81.

The Coastal Highlands
The land in the southeastern corner of Obojima rises
sharply from the Gale Fields and Brackwater Wetlands,
forming a plateau of craggy rock that ends at the sea as a
dramatic, sheer cliff. Within the cliff face are several sprawling networks of caves that open out over the sea.
For more on the Coastal Highlands and the locations in it,
see page 97.

The Shallows
Obojima is ringed by a reef known as the Shallows. The
beach drops under the surf creating a sandy bottom that
stretches out several miles offshore and can get to a depth of
200 feet before the reef rises up, creating a coral wonderland
around Obojima. Beyond, a steep shelf gives way to the deep
waters of the open ocean. Aside from being home to all kinds
of sea creatures, a portion of the Shallows is also claimed by
the Lionfish King, who has become increasingly agitated and
belligerent since the Corruption arrived on the island.
For more on the Shallows and the locations in it, see
page 108.

Locations
Below, you will find 30 unique locations found all across the island. These locations are organized by region and range from a
small ramen shop to the largest city on Obojima. However, these are not the only important locations on the island. There are
many unlisted towns and villages, which we implore you to create yourself.

Player Information VS GM Information
At the start of every location is a paragraph or more of text which gives the reader a general overview of the location.
This section is intended for players and GMs to read. The text that follows the Blue “Tone / Vibe” section is for GMs only.

THE GIFT OF SHURITASHI
The Gift of Shuritashi, known by locals as “the Gift,” is named after the legendary spirit Shuritashi who once roamed
Obojima. This region is a harmonious blend of tropical paradise and pastoral tranquility. Its landscape is a tapestry of verdant
farmland, thick forests, and rolling hills blanketed in lush meadows where the scent of flowers fills the air. In the valleys,
gentle rivers meander towards the coast and the golden beaches that the Gift is known for.
Scattered across the land are quaint villages and towns where the rhythm of life is slow and relaxed. The inhabitants,
primarily farmers and craftspeople, cultivate the land, growing vegetables, spices, tea, and fruit, as well as raising all manner
of livestock to graze the hillsides. These settlements, with their thatched roofs and open markets, exude a rustic charm that
complements the natural beauty surrounding them. The artisans’ handiwork captures the essence of Shuritashi’s spirit in
their intricate crafts. In the Gift, the serene lull of nature and the gentle hum of daily life merge together to create a sanctuary
where the legacy of the great spirit Shuritashi resonates in every rustling leaf and crashing wave.

COASTAL DIVERS’ LODGE
SOUTHERN BRANCH

O

ne of the two remaining divers’ lodges is the southern branch, which is located in the Gift of Shuritashi. Like the other
divers’ lodges, the southern branch has a deep connection to the Clintock name. It was the renowned Captain Clintock
who first established the lodge with the Mariners’ Guild in an abandoned fisherman’s cliff dwelling decades ago, and the
captain’s eldest daughter, Paloma, now looks after the place. Though general interest in ocean exploration has waned across the
island, stalwarts who still heed the lure of the sea continue to be drawn to the lodge. Along with Paloma, a handful of guild
members live at the lodge, and at any given time, there might be a handful of guests or researchers staying here as well.
The Lodge’s position in the cliff wall has proved perfectly situated to ward off attacks from the Lionfish King’s warriors.

Tone/Vibe
Eclectic, Comradely, Empty

Aquarium
The southern divers’ lodge is known for its aquarium,
which hosts a rotating collection of marine creatures that
the resident naturalist studies before releasing them back
into the wild.

24

Captain of the Pointue
Clintock himself is currently in residence while his submarine, the Pointue, remains in drydock for repairs.

Old Feud
Captain Clintock and the Lionfish King have maintained a
decades long feud that accounts for much of the mayhem in
the Shallows during that time. Both parties have reason to
hate the other. The Lionfish King spent time as a prisoner in
the spirit town of Uluwa due to Clintock’s handywork, and he
in turn managed to sink the captain’s original submersible—
the Pointue.

However, Captain Clintock’s usual resolve at countering
his bitter foe appears to have diminished since his most
recent arrival at the lodge. Paloma believes it’s his age that
has tempered him, despite his insistence that dealing with
the Corruption is far more important right now.

New Menace
Corrupted fish folk from the eastern side of the island
have begun encroaching on the domain of the Lionfish
King. Paloma only recently encountered them when they
attacked her ship. She managed to escape, but not before
one of the attacker’s darts struck her, secretly infecting
her with the Corruption.

Corruption Research
Captain Clintock brought with him samples of Corruption-affected aquatic life, and the resident member of AHA
has been researching it, much to the discomfort of the
other lodge members.

NPCs
Paloma Clintock (female human). Paloma runs the lodge
and to her, it’s her castle. She grew up traveling between
the four divers lodges, but she always felt like the southern
branch was home. She lacks her sister Holly’s gift for engineering, but her strength is in her fearlessness, which tends
to dip into recklessness. Though she loves her father and
sister, the members of this lodge have become closer to her
than her family.

personality who is quick to laugh and share in the laughter
of others. He serves as the lodge’s chef, with meals prepared
from the fish he catches on his morning dives. When he’s
not in the water or in the kitchen, the lodge echoes with
the jaunty sounds of his accordion. He is the glue that
keeps the lodge together.
Leobini, the Navigator (male human). The old navigator has lived at the lodge longer than anyone and they are
one of Captain Clintock’s closest friends. Leobini moves
about the lodge with the help of a crab-like spirit named
Mr. Tamlin, who carries the navigator on its back. Although
they rarely go on excursions these days, they’re more
than happy to tell one or more of the thousands of stories
they know about sea monsters, brave sailors, and foolish
captains to any and that will listen.
Dahlia, Apprentice Diver (female elf). After a diver
passed away in an excursion in the Land of Hot Water,
Paloma invited his young daughter, Dahlia, to stay at the
lodge. Dahlia’s mother had passed just a few months prior,
so the young lady was quick to accept the offer and grateful
to have a place to stay. Since then, Dahlia has come into her
own, and has become a beloved member of the lodge. Known
as a bookworm, Dahlia spends much of her time at the lodge
investigating objects from the First Age that were hauled
up from the sea. She has a deep fascination
with action figures, and she might have
the largest such collection on the island.
Since the return of Captain Clintock, she’s
assisted in his research of the Corruption.

With the increasing belligerence of the fish folk, Paloma
has recently begun launching solitary missions into the
domain of the Lionfish King to disrupt possible attacks.
On these missions, she wears a magical cloak of mist that
spreads around her and her small ship.
Captain Clintock (male human). The captain of the
Pointue is a man of few words, but he can command a room
with his presence. He is driven, introspective, and insatiably curious about the sea. The sea is his passion, and as he
ages, he is increasingly aware that his legacy of celebrating
the world beneath the waves will be overshadowed by his
squabbles with the Lionfish King.
The Corruption he encountered during his most recent
voyage to the eastern side of the island has kindled a new
sense of purpose, as the threat to the sea life he reveres
is threatened.
The only thing Captain Clintock loves more than the sea
are his daughters, whom he is immensely proud of, though
his affection for them is reserved for the letters he sends
from his voyages.

Points of Interest

Paloma believes he is a saboteur or assassin sent by the
Lionfish King, but Captain Clintock is ready to trust him.

The Pointue. There’s no mistaking Captain Clintock’s
submarine, which is shaped like a giant, plump swordfish.
The Pointue’s riveted exterior and bulbous lines gives it a
clunky appearance, but it is actually quite graceful in the
water. The interior sports elegant dark wood paneling and
chic furniture from an older age.

The Rare Strobe Fish. A few days ago, Figby was on a
dive and spotted a rare species of fish he’s been calling the
strobe fish. He was hoping to study it, but he had to retreat
because he was nearly out of breath. He desperately wants
to study it and would love some help finding it and perhaps
even capturing it for his aquarium.

Captain Clintock is most proud of the Pointue’s robust
nautical library, which includes a small collection of documentary films about the sea.

Transport the Pointue. The Lionfish King will stop at
nothing to destroy his most hated foe’s precious submarine,
and a recent raid almost succeeded. Captain Clintock can no
longer wait for his engineer daughter, Holly, to come from
the northern lodge to repair the Pointue, so he enlists the
adventurers to escort the vessel.

The Pointue is no ordinary vessel. It is both a mechanical
and magical marvel. It never runs out of breathable air, and
it can even stretch to pass through narrow passages, though
this power has a limit. The swordfish’s sword is no mere
decoration, as many of the Lionfish King’s ships rotting on
the seafloor can attest.
At present, the Pointue is in drydock at the divers’ lodge.
The submarine, which had been damaged during an expedition to the island’s Corruption-tainted coastline, is in
need of repairs, but the Lionfish King prevented the captain
from voyaging to the divers’ lodge in the north, where his
mechanically gifted daughter, Holly, and the appropriate
tools to fix the submersible reside. As no one here knows
how to fix the Pointue, it remains at the southern branch
along with the captain.
The Ogo Mo Vogo. The lodge’s closest neighbor is an enormous spirit that resembles a snail with a multi-spired shell
that sparkles in moonlight. The spirit is called the Ogo Mo
Vogo, a fact that everyone who comes near it somehow spontaneously knows. The Ogo Mo Vogo seems to favor the lodge,
and it is often found clinging to the cliff face close-by. The
lodge’s resident naturalist, Figby, discovered that the spirit is
often willing to transport people it trusts down to the seafloor.

Rumors and Legends
Taverns along the Gift of Shuritashi are abuzz with chatter
about a mysterious vessel that’s been seen intercepting and
driving off fish folk raiders. The rumor credits the lodge,
with most folks speculating that Captain Clintock is the
unsung hero.
The Coastal Divers’ Lodge connects to two of Obojima’s
looming dangers—the ongoing conflict with the fish folk
of the Lionfish King’s domain, and the threat posed by the
Corruption. The lodge serves as a great location to bring the
adventurers in contact with either issue or as a jumping off
point to explore the Shallows.

Adventure Hooks
Missing Diver. When the adventurers arrive, they soon
discover from the divers at the lodge that one of
their members went missing the night before.
Most believe he was taken by fish folk raiders, but whether they were sent by the
Lionfish King or by the Venomous Rex
is not known. Paloma Clintock asks the
adventurers to help her find her friend.
Fish Folk Defector. A fish folk turns
up at the lodge, claiming they no longer
want to serve the Lionfish King, who
they claim has grown paranoid and
unstable. He says he has information about an impending attack
on the village of Tidewater.

THE POINTUE

L

MATANGO VILLAGE

ocated in a damp, forested pocket in the western foothills of Mount Arbora is a village of mushroom farmers, who have
discovered a patch of woods so steeped in magic that the lichen and fungi they grow there have reached such extraordinary sizes that they are large enough to live inside of and for generations, that is exactly what they’ve done. What was
once an empty forest floor and canopy are now sprawling with magnificent homes and businesses, all carved from the giant
mushrooms the farmers planted so many years ago.

Tone/Vibe
Festive, Jovial, Inviting, Magical

Reputation
Matango Village is known to villages in proximity to it or
by anyone who has an affinity for mushrooms, like chefs
and healers. There are a few who go there to experience its
other features, like purchasing some fine clothing from the
Red Chanterelles or experiencing the solitude of the Reishi
Clan Monastery.

Mushroom Clans

years to produce the optimal conditions for their fungi to
bear fruit. This terraforming has created sections of the
surrounding forest that are unique to each of the families.

Culture in Matango
The farming community of Matango Village has always
been jovial and kind to one another. Each week, the villagers gather in the center of town where they swap stories,
share new ideas, discuss whose gourmet mushrooms are the
most coveted, and, after a bountiful harvest, they host their
mushroom market where buyers come from all around to
purchase the latest flush of mushrooms.
The quaint town is also known for its Truffle Festival,
which sees eager truffle hunters from all across the island
flooding into the nearby woods.

There are several known farming groups in Matango Village,
each one with its own specialty mushroom that they have
grown for generations. They’ve cultivated the land for

Farmers of
Matango Village

Since then the woods have slowly become infused with
Roghora’s magic, shaping the land to its liking and producing an abundance of its favorite food—mushrooms.

Matsutake Gang. The Matsutake Gang are a proud, rough
and tumble group of disparate people who joined together
out of a sense of found family and a common love of mushrooms. Matsutake Gang members are often covered in earth
from their work cultivating and harvesting their produce
and live in large, rough hewn houses.

NPCs

Red Chanterelles. The Red Chanterelles are a family of
fashionable farmers who are known for their crimson cloth
and exceptional haberdashery. Along with their outstanding mushrooms, the Red Chanterelles produce fine clothing,
lush dyes, and stylish shoes.
Reishi Clan. The Reishi Clan are an order of farmer-philosophers who live and work in a way where farming has
become a deep, contemplative act. Their monastic lifestyle
has become known throughout Obojima, and occasionally
the Reishi Clan will allow visitors to come to their mushroom monastery and meditate.
Porcini Family. The Porcini family has been in Matango
for generations, and are known for their singing, their
joie de vivre, and their lavish dinner parties where any
welcomed guest becomes an honorary Porcini family
member for the evening. Although the Porcini family is well
cultured, they are not above rolling up their sleeves, gathering their gardening tools, and standing fast to fend off
would-be mushroom thieves.

Reheni, the Current Truffle Prince (female human).
Reheni is a good-natured young woman who, with the help
of her pet piglet, Gooma, won last year’s Truffle Hunt, and
is now reaping the rewards. She proudly wears the regalia around the village and passes on any wisdom that she
gleans from her contact with the Great Pig Spirit, Roghora.
Myron the Lichen Sage (male human). Myron is the
village druid who has taken it upon himself to make sure
that the special magic of Matango Village, which allows for
such phenomenal mushroom growth, is kept in balance
and that the proper spirits are appeased. He can often
be found digging and sniffing in the soil, dowsing with
his divining rod, or wandering the forest humming an
ever-changing tune.
Chogo (male human). The leader of the Matsutake Gang is
a heavyset, muscular man in his mid-thirties named Chogo.
Chogo is rough on the exterior, but underneath all the
tattoos and sternness lies a heart of gold. His main concern
is caring for the well-being of all the waifs, urchins, drifters,
and ragamuffins that have found a home in the Matsutake
Gang and making sure that they all find a sense of purpose
and belonging.

The Reign of the
Truffle Prince
Every year, people from around the island descend on
Matango Village to participate in the annual Truffle Hunt.
A celebrated competition where hundreds of villagers,
adventurers, and truffle aficionados search the wilderness
surrounding the village in hopes to find as many of the 73
unique mushrooms that grow in the area. The winner of
the contest is crowned the Truffle Prince, a title that comes
with the distinction of communing with the Great Pig
Spirit, Roghora, and enjoying delightful feasts prepared in
the spirit’s honor. The Truffle Prince reigns, enjoying all the
benefits and honors befitting the title, until the next hunt
the following year.

The Domain of
Roghora
The elder pig spirit, Roghora, has called the Matango woods
its home for centuries. It’s said that the spirit found respite
here after it fought the Great River Mu and lost in a devastating defeat that nearly took Roghora’s life. While injured,
Roghora lived in the woods, feasting on the vast variety of
mushrooms and wildlife. After a year of recovery, Roghora
eventually decided to stay and make the land its domain.

REHENI

Marvolio (male human).
The majordomo of the Red Chanterelles is
the dashing and ever-fashionable Marvolio. It is well known in Matango Village
that Marvolio has brought the Red Chanterelles to a new level of creativity and
style. Some say that Marvolio is a genius,
whether that is true or not, what is
known is that he is uncompromising
when it comes to his vision.
Whenever possible,
Marvolio seeks out
possible collaboration
with famed adventurers and festival
winners. As he always says,
“An icon of the island must be dressed
to impress, and what’s more impressive than a Chanterelle original”.

MARVOLIO

Mama Amala (female human).
The head of the Reishi Clan is Amala,
an intense yet gentle woman in her mid
50’s. A handshake from her lets anyone
know the power—physical and spiritual—that lies within her unassuming form. She is welcoming and is
a wealth of information, happy to
share her knowledge with anyone who is wise enough
to listen. Her mission is to bring the power of the forest
spirits through the fungi that the Reishi Clan cultivate. It is
her belief that being connected to the island brings humility, insight, and intelligence.
Madame Porcini (female human). The head of the
Porcini household is a stout and friendly woman everyone calls Madame Porcini. On arrival at the border of the
Porcini farm, the first thing you’ll hear is the lilting voice of
Madame Porcini singing to her mushroom fields along with
the rest of the extended Porcini family chiming in. Everyone in Matango Village associates her voice with good food
and a grand party.

Pig Pen. The aptly named Pig Pen is the communal home
and facility of a local guild of big farmers known as Snout.
For decades the guild has produced some of the highest quality truffle hunting pigs the town has seen, all of which were
born and raised behind the closed doors of their barn-like
manor. Recently, they have lost some of their sway within
the community after the title of Truffle Prince was given to
Reheni and her mutt of a truffle-hunting pig, Gooma.
Moss Boiler. This outdoor food stall is home to a local
delicacy called moss boil, an unusual dish that takes the
normally inedible laughing moss and turns it into a deliciously complex and springy faux noodle dish. The
famed dish was created by the owner and chef of
the Moss Boiler, Rokoko, a large bipedal beetle
spirit and collector of odd ingredients. Since
the humble shop was established a year ago,
Rokoko has enjoyed the fame of a local celebrity
but in recent months has struggled to keep up with the
demand his fame has created.

Adventure Hooks
Mushroom Raiders! A collection of greedy spirits and
mushroom poachers have set up a camp not far from town.
The 4 major mushroom clans are in a panic trying to decide
what to do about it.
Angered Spirits. The farmers of Matango Village are experiencing a sudden and underwhelmingly low yield in their
most recent crop. Myron the Lichen Sage believes that the
cause is an angry spirit of the forest that has not been properly appeased. He needs help scouring the forest to find the
angered spirit.
Moss Doesn’t Grow on Trees. Rokoko, the owner of the
Moss Boiler, is in desperate need of more Laughing Moss.
His famous dish requires a heap of the uncommon potion
ingredient and he’s dangerously low in supply. Those willing to hunt down the illusive moss can trade for any one
ingredient from his curated collection.
Joining the Truffle Hunt. The adventurers have joined
the annual Truffle Hunt with little time to prepare. They
must quickly gather their gear and start their search for
the rarest of fungi this side of the mountain. To find these
elusive mushrooms, they must work as a team to scour the
forest floor, but that’s not the only thing they’ll need to
worry about. A group of howlers are heading to the village
and, if they arrive, they’re sure to ruin the festival.

Points of Interest
Mushroom Houses. Each farming clan in Matango Village
has a giant house version of their particular species of
mushroom, complete with hallways, staircases, and rooms
in which the group lives. There are smaller mushroom
houses that surround the main house, where guests and
other members of the farming community live. These
homes are carved from centuries-old mushrooms that can
grow in the forest in the right conditions.

Q

OKIRI VILLAGE

uaint, charming, and idyllic, Okiri is a farming village in the Gift of Shuritashi, nestled in rolling hills between a
modest wood and a lazy river. It’s a place where everyone knows everyone else. The river, which flows south from
Mount Arbora, intersects with the east-west road, placing Okiri on a crossroads. Travelers frequently pass through the
village, bringing news from the outside world, but generally, Okiri has remained somewhat insulated from the larger dangers
that lurk in the vast expanse of the Gale Fields just beyond the farmland.
Though small, Okiri boasts a diverse population, with Nakudama, humans, and elves all making the village their home for
generations. The history of the village stretches back to the earliest days of the Nakudama Age, and then, like today, has been
the stomping grounds for a variety of nature and beast spirits.
Compared to other villages of similar size, Okiri supports quite a large amount of trade. The village is perhaps best known
for its sheep dragon herders, who shear the wool to craft a variety of goods such as wooly hats, sweaters, cloth, and blankets.
Other villagers grow a variety of vegetables, fish on the river, or ply their trade as craftspeople.

Tone/Vibe

The Importance of
Sheep Dragons
Okiri is known for the quality of wool it produces, which
comes from the sheep dragons that graze the surrounding
hills. Sheep dragons are clever and mischievous creatures,
and tending to them is no easy task. There is great pride
among the shepherds of Okiri for the rich tradition that
they are a part of. The village has embraced sheep dragons
to such a degree that its sigil depicts one.

The Farm Collective

NPCs

Okiri is a village of many faces. Most of the time, it’s a
sleepy farming village, but market days and festivals transform it into a festive hub, where folk from villages come
throughout the region to celebrate, trade, and compete. The
festivals are determined by and even named for certain
crops. The Cabbage Festival and Wrinklefruit Festival tend
to draw the largest crowds.

Broad Naldo (male human). Naldo is built like an ox, with
a large, muscled frame and thick arms. If not for his boyish,
friendly face and easy smile, folk might flinch at the sight of
him. He is always eager to help, and he can usually be found
on one of the farms lending a hand, or delivering heavy
things to folks in the village. Naldo is a bit of a chatterbox,
and can be easily distracted, which is why he employs his
hound companion, Block, to keep him on track.

Festival Games
Most festival days are accompanied by festival games,
which have become a major reason why people from nearby
villages and farmsteads descend on Okiri. All at the festival
are welcome to join in the games, which include wrestling
and tests of accuracy of various sorts.
However, the main event is a game called blotcher, where
participants are divided into teams, and each person is given
a shepherd sling and a bag of overripe produce to hurl at the
other team. A variant of the game lets folks use pot lids as
shields. Participants must wear a traditional tunic of undyed
wool so that when a person is hit with a flying fruit or
vegetable, it’ll leave a clear blotch. The game is played over a
series of rounds, each one featuring a different projectile. By
the end of the match, the participants are covered in multicolored stains, which they are encouraged to wear proudly.

Okiri is a feel good village—a location where
nothing catastrophic happens. No matter what’s
going on in the world, the people of the village
seem to be unconcerned and unaware. Possibly to
their detriment. Communicating its charm, and
fostering connections between the adventurers
and the villagers can really help Okiri become a
beloved location, and a place they look forward to
returning to throughout your Obojima campaign

Miss Lindley (female human). When equipment fails
in Okiri, villagers look to Miss Lindley to repair them but
not without a bit of trepidation. Miss Lindley is usually not
one to entertain guests, and expects visitors and customers
to be direct with their requests. If asked to make a repair,
she’ll often demand that she be brought some seemingly
absurd component in order to complete the task. One time, a
customer presented her with a busted plow, and Miss Lindley
told her to return with a bucket of shards of blue glass and a
turnip—“and the glass had better be blue!” But folk stopped
questioning their odd duck neighbor because objects that
have passed through her care are often better than new.
What the people of Okiri don’t know is that their peculiar
repair specialist is a witch and was once one of the most
powerful and politically influential witches in the Fish Head
Coven as a member of the Council of Three and Thirty.
She retired years ago, and she now uses her transmutation
magic to conduct her trade.
The Torrelli Brothers (male humans). Thim and Torrio
Torrelli are the most adventurous shepherds in the area,
taking their sheep dragons to graze lands far from the
village. Their wanderings make them a great source of
information about the outside world, though they often lace

Life in Okiri
Okiri describes the village and the stretch of farms and grazing lands that reach from the village to the edge of the Gale
Fields. The folk living in farmsteads are considered villagers
every bit as much as those with homes in the village proper.
Tradition guides day-to-day life for most villagers. All
trades and associated responsibilities are handed down
through generations.
The people of Okiri have a strong sense of community, and
they prefer a light touch when it comes to governance. Most
of the time, villagers handle their issues among themselves,
and only in major disputes between neighbors, or in matters
of the village’s defense will they call together representatives
of the farmers, shepherds, fishers, and crafters to gather at
the hall known as High Hearth, to decide on such matters.

their tales with humorous anecdotes. Both brothers love to
collect and share jokes, and they spend much of their time
cracking each other up while their flock grazes. The pair
are also formidable slingers, and tend to do quite well in
blotcher matches.
Morna (female Nakudama). If you’re new in the village,
there’s a good chance you’re being watched. Morna, a
Nakudama child, loves shirking her work to spy on strangers who she claims, “are too damn interesting!” She’s not
shy. She simply likes to observe newcomers, and she can
appear in random hiding places all over Okiri. If she’s
discovered, she’ll happily engage in conversation, though.
Morna is fearless, and she is drawn to dangerous places,
as they hold the greatest potential for fun. She has a small
knife that she found, and she likes to play with it, pleased
that it seems to make adults uncomfortable. Morna might
just be the best informed person in the whole village.
Wenneth (female human). Okiri is not known for its
warriors, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any here.
Wenneth, a middle-aged farmer living with her family on the
village outskirts is a sanctioned sword champion representing the island’s sword schools. Those aspiring to join one of
the schools can challenge Wenneth to a friendly duel. She is
ruthless with a blade but encouraging to her opponents.

For folks traveling east, Okiri Village is the
last settlement before entering the Gale Fields.
As such, the Courier Brigade maintains an
outpost here. It has a stable that is always
stocked with one or two fresh mounts for
courier brigadiers passing through.

Points of Interest
The Commons. At the center of Okiri village is the
commons, a low mound covered in grass and topped by
three pillars of stone, each one a different height. The
grass here is usually left overgrown until the “grazing of the commons” when the sheep dragons are
permitted to eat the grass. This tradition prepares
the site for blotcher to be played here.
The High Hall. This tall timber hall is built on a
rise on the bank of the creek. It’s not always in
use, but it serves multiple functions
in Okiri. First, the High Hall
is where village meetings are
held. In winter, it’s transformed
into a more traditional feasting
hall. Finally, it’s likely the sturdiest structure in the village, so it’s
where folks gather if the village is
ever under attack. The cellar even has a
small cache of weapons that can be distributed
to a makeshift militia if necessary.

32

Outdoor Hearths. Okiri villagers have a tradition of eating
outdoors whenever possible to encourage gatherings. Beside
the commons is a cluster of cooking sites, each one with its
own hearth set into the floor of a gazebo. A derelict food
truck and relic from the First Age stands at the center of
the gathered gazebos like a monument to outdoor dining.
Bree’s Mercantile. This simple merchant shop is the only
one in Okiri. It has a decent variety of general goods, but it
specializes in selling potion ingredients. The shop’s proprietor is Bree, a small, roundish spirit with prickly skin that
resembles the outside of a Pyramid Melon. She is happy to
take customers’ money but prefers a good trade.
Sheep Dragon Grazing Grounds. Beyond the orchards and
tilled farmland is a large span of low hills that shepherds
use to graze their sheep dragons. The land is dotted with
rusted out husks of vehicles from the First Age. It’s generally a quiet place, well away from the village proper, but
even still it has its unique dangers. Hill dragons have been
known to ambush travelers, and on rare occasions, field
giants range into this territory, causing panic as they go.

Adventure Hooks
Party Crashers. The celebratory air of one of the village’s
vegetable festivals attracts a rowdy band of yokarios whose
antics threaten to disrupt all the fun.
The Flying Bicycle. A young boy in town got a hold of a
levitation potion and poured it on the spokes of his bike
and climbed on, hoping to join a school of flying jellyfish
passing overhead. His bike carried him skyward, but it
doesn’t look like it’s coming down any time soon. Terrified,
the boy’s parents implore the adventurers to get their son
back safely.
Missing Shepherds. At dawn, a lone sheep dragon is
spotted in the center of town. It’s recognized as one the
Torrelli brothers’ flock. No one can find the two
shepherds, however. The grazing grounds might point to
what happened.
Settle it on the Field. On the eve of a festival, braggarts
from a neighboring village stir up trouble by picking
fights with the locals, and then with the adventurers. If
things escalate, the locals intervene, and challenge both groups to settle the issue on the
blotcher field.
Deputy Couriers. When an injured
courier brigadier enters the town
wounded and exhausted, she deputizes the adventurers and charges
them with completing the delivery
of an important parcel bound for
the Graysteps on Mount Arbora.

OUTDOOR HEARTH

TEMPLE OF SHOOM

n a remote part of the Gift of Shuritashi, an ancient Nakudama ziggurat stands, mostly submerged, in the deep waters of
Lake Ellior, one of Obojima’s great lakes. The ziggurat is called Shoom, and though time and neglect have taken their toll,
the structure remains mostly intact.

The ruins of a settlement on the lake’s southern shore hint at the site’s bygone importance. At the height of the Nakudama
monarchy period, Shoom was part of a sprawling complex where Nakudama families came to hatch their young and stay for
a time to raise them in their earliest days of life. The ziggurat was where the eggs were brought, and the waters were carefully
monitored and maintained by a host of midwives and attendants who kept the conditions here ideal. It was the largest such
site on the island, and even took on a semi-sacred status by the time it had been largely abandoned centuries ago.
Shoom is seldom visited today by Nakudama, let alone other travelers. The fact that the site was so thoroughly forgotten
might indicate that the cultural amnesia surrounding it was deliberate.

Tone/Vibe
Mysterious, ancient, hopeful, ominous

Lake Ellior

Rumors and Legends
There are no widespread stories about Shoom, and the ones
that do exist don’t shed much light on the place. The only
tidbit worth hearing that has been attributed to Shoom
is that people ceased visiting all at once when the water
became home to a dangerous beast.

As the largest lake on the island, Ellior was once the cradle
of nakumada civilization, and pockets of ruins can be found
all along the lakeshore. The lake is deepest at its northern
end, and that’s where the ziggurat stands.

33

Shoom is a great place to have adventurers
explore part of Obojima’s history as well as ancient Nakudama culture. If it fits your campaign,
you could present Shoom as a sunken dungeon
with each of the stacked tiers offering their own
challenges to overcome.

Why Shoom was
Abandoned
At its height, Shoom was a thriving hatchery with scores
of families visiting at any given time to hatch their young.
Seemingly all at once, the place was abandoned and
promptly forgotten. Here’s why:
After being central to Nakudama culture, Shoom was
deserted and left to languish in its lake soon after the
enigmatic figure known as Vararo the Parasite showed up.
The charismatic Voraro, a Nakudama known for his oracular powers, claimed he knew the destinies of all living
creatures. Parents intent on knowing the fortunes of their
children brought Voraro to Shoom. Once inside the ziggurat, the truth of Voraro’s powers became known. He was a
warlock who served a greedy and gluttonous spirit. Voraro
used his magic to enthrall many midwives and offered the
Nakudama eggs as tribute to his spirit patron. Unable to
drive Voraro and the spirit out, it was decided to seal them
in the ziggurat and abandon Shoom.

Shoom Today
Left derelict for centuries, Shoom was recently rediscovered
by an expedition of eight Nakudama midwives who’d been
seeking the site for some time. The earthquake and the
tsunami that followed spurred them to look for answers in
the history of their people. Upon entering the ziggurat, they
took to restoring it with the hope of rededicating the place
as a Nakudama hatchery. The work has been slow going,
and their leader, Beatri, has gone missing.
The ziggurat is operational again, and despite the possible
dangers, word has spread. For the first time in many centuries, families are making the trek.

The Lingering Power
of Voraro
Voraro the Parasite’s power is once again stirring after a
long hibernation. He is biding his time, for he believes
his patience will be rewarded with ever more Nakudama
returning to the site to be enthralled and consumed by his
spirit patron. He now aims to lure more Nakudama back
here to enthrall or feast upon.

34

Ziggurat Features
Tiers
The ziggurat of Shoom is made up of six rectangular tiers.
Each tier is 15 feet tall. The bottom tier is 100 feet wide and 80
feet long, and each tier above is smaller than the one below
until the top tier, which is 25 feet wide and 20 feet long.
The top two tiers are the only ones above the waterline.

Entrances
There are two ways to get into the ziggurat. The main
entrance is in through the rounded entryways set into the
eastern and western walls of the ziggurats top tier.
The second entrance in the bottom tier of the ziggurat.
This secret passage is through the flood mechanism and can
easily be exploited by smaller creatures.

Flood Mechanism
The ziggurat was built with an ingenious mechanism that
controls the water level within it. Two levers control it, and
they must both be toggled the same direction to either let
water in or draw it out. One lever is in the second tier from
the top. The other is in the Chamber of Future Monarchs.

Points of Interest
Reception Area. The top tier of the ziggurat was originally
designed to be a comfortable waiting room for families
arriving to give birth at the hatchery. The inner wall still
bears the faded and flaking remnant of a fresco featuring
a Nakudama monarch with arms outstretched in a gesture
of welcome. The midwives now use this chamber as their
quarters and it’s where the bulk of their restoration efforts
are currently taking place. At any given time there are likely
three to seven midwives here.

Old Quarters. A spiral stair leads from the top tier down to
the second. This is where the midwives of old used to live.
A cursory glance in this area reveals only bits of broken
pottery and the occasional piece of rotting wood. A successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a secret alcove
in the wall of this chamber. Within the alcove is a lever,
which is one of the two needed to operate the Flood Mechanism (see below).
This tier bears the only indication that the ziggurat
had been occupied at all during its long abandonment
by anything other than creatures. An enclosed chamber
contains a fully stocked vending machine, three derelict
arcade games with anonymous cabinets, and a stack of Ava
and the Allstars collected edition books. Anyone who spends
at least 10 minutes searching this area finds a spell scroll
containing the daylight spell tucked into one of the books.
1st, 2nd, & 3rd Hatchery. The three middle tiers make up
the core of the ziggurat. Each space is perfectly rounded like
a compressed bubble, the polar opposite of the angular exterior. This is where the Nakudama once come to hatch their
eggs. Under the care of the midwives, eggs were placed in
niches cut into the walls and pillars. Now, only inky water
fills these vast chambers. Aquatic elementals who once
served the midwives now patrol the water here.
Chamber of Future Monarchs. At the very bottom of the
primary hatchery is a small but ornate enclosure. This area
was kept for royal eggs, on the occasion that the monarchs
desired to visit Shoom. Now, it serves as Voraro’s lair.
An alcove in the wall contains a lever. This is one of the
two levers that operate the ziggurat’s flood mechanism.

NPCs

Adventure Hooks
AHA Expedition. Dini, a Nakudama member of AHA,
enlists the adventurers to accompany them to Shoom as
part of their field research on the Nakudama Age. Dini is
unaware of midwives’ expedition or of Voraro’s presence in
the ziggurat.
The Royal Egg. While exploring Shoom, the adventurers
stumble across a single Nakudama egg that had been magically preserved within the ziggurat and miraculously left
uneaten by Voraro and his patron spirit. If they share their
discovery with anyone, such as the midwives, word spreads
across the island. When word reaches the Lionfish King, he
sends his minions to capture the egg for himself so he can
assert a claim on the ancient title of monarch.
Spellbound. All at once, Nakudama from across the
southern portion of the Gift of Shuritashi felt compelled
to leave their homes and travel to Shoom. If asked about it,
the traveling Nakudama explain it as an act of spontaneity.
What they don’t know is that Voraro is desperate to appease
his spirit patron and has spent his powers to stretch his
enthralling magic to reach Nakudama far and wide, pulling
them to Shoom. Once there, Voraro plans to offer them up
to be devoured by his patron spirit.
Missing Midwife. Midwife Beatri has gone missing. The
other midwives are desperate to find her. They’ve searched
the lakeshore and all over the top two tiers of the Ziggurat,
but it’s as though she disappeared. The last anyone saw of
her, she had begun clearing the second tier.
ZOLDE OF
THE MIDWIVES

Zolde of the Midwives (female Nakudama). Zolde is the
de facto leader of the midwives currently living in the ruins
at the lakeshore. She has a broad build and a perpetual
scowl on her face, though she insists, “it’s just the way my
face looks.” She is gruff and leary of strangers, but is warm
hearted. Before becoming a midwife, she was an adventurer
in her own right, and she can still swing a sword. Zolde
was not the leader when the group set out, but when Beatri
went missing, the other midwives naturally looked to her.
Voraro the Parasite (male Nakudama). Voraro is an
ancient Nakudama who has made the ziggurat his lair.
He is a powerful warlock who remains tightly bound to
his unnamed spirit patron. He is centuries old, his life
sustained by dark magic. Since being sealed in the ziggurat,
he has grown large and bloated, and he can no longer tolerate being outside of water. His primary focus is on finding
more Nakudama for his patron to consume.

TIDEWATER
THE VILLAGE OF SAND

T

hose who are repeat visitors to the Village of Sand never see the same village more than once. Change is such a constant
here that it has earned the colloquial name of “Village of Sand.” It is also why the Village of Sand is among Obojima’s
wonders. The village boasts master sculptors who create the colorful sand structures that give the village its name. With
few exceptions, every building is made of hardened sand using a special spell that originates from the village. Rival sculptors
compete with each other to construct wildly outlandish structures that push the limits of their craft with the help of giant
crabs specially trained for the task. In this fashion, the Village of Sand has seen countless versions of itself, each one a temporary work of art. The fleeting nature of the village’s look is a point of cultural pride among the residents, who even create
colored sand so that their village appears in a variety of vibrant colors.

The Pearl of Rongol
The history of the village predates its tradition of sand
building. In fact, it started as a sacred site when a diver
named Rongol pulled an enormous pearl from the ocean.
When he placed it on the sand, storm clouds gathered over-

36

head and moments later, a bolt of lightning arced down,
missing the pearl by inches and striking the sand instead.
A twisting tower of fulgurite rose up where the lightning
touched the sand, forming a tower of glass around the pearl.
Rongol became the first of the pearl’s caretakers, contemplating the pearl from within the Tower of Glass.
Even though the Village of Sand grew up around the
Tower of Glass, the pearl’s acolytes prefer a mostly hermetic
existence, emerging only occasionally with an omen to
share with the village’s residents.

Threat from the Sea
Fish folk raiders pose a real and constant threat to the
people of Tidewater. Attacks come mostly at night, which is
why sand sculptors use their magic to raise a sandy bulwark
to surround the village at dusk each day, only to dissolve
it at sunrise. Though large-scale raids have tapered off as a
result, clever raiders continue to find ways into the village
from time to time.

Washing Up on Shore
The other curiosity that attracts visitors to the Village of
Sand is the peculiar regularity with which stuff seems
to wash up on the beach here. Enormous bones from an
unknown species, bits of a wrecked ship, and bottled maps
are only the most recent arrivals. This detritus is so infused
with the village’s identity that some residents decorate their
sand-build homes with the interesting items that wash up.

NPCs
Vorian, Apprentice Sand Sculptor (male elf). The young
elf is humble, shy, unsure of himself, and a perpetual
mumbler–everything their mentor, the Great Ferek, is not,
including being a gifted sand sculptor. Vorian is the true
genius, and it’s been by his attention to detail and diligence
that Ferek has come to enjoy his celebrity. Vorian has no interest in self-aggrandizement, preferring instead to
continue his efforts to turn sand
into works of art. When he’s not
running about the village on errands
VORIAN
for his mentor, Vorian can often be
found sitting outside, scribbling
in his vast sketchbook spread
across his lap. Vorian uses the
commoner stat block.
Ulmat, The Pearl’s Omenspeaker (female dara).
This dara is easily the tallest person in the village
and possibly in the whole of
the Gift of Shuritashi region.
It falls to her to declare the
omens she gleans from the
pearl. Her voice carries with
it an otherworldly quality that
everything she says sounds like a
dire omen, even when she’s engaged
in simple chitchat. She is the only
acolyte who leaves the Tower of Glass
with any regularity, and she can be
spotted strolling in the sculpture park,
admiring the latest iterations. Most folks
give Ulmat a wide berth, but she delights
in conversation, especially about art.

Gritty Groff, The Sand Witch (female human). A strange
and solitary witch who lives on the outskirts of the village,
Gritty Groff prefers the company of her two giant sand fleas,
Fleck and Speck. She has an abundance of knowledge about
the Shallows, and it’s even rumored that she once served
as advisor to the Lionfish King. It’s not true, of course, but
it keeps most folks out of her way. Despite her antisocial
nature, she remains near Tidewater because she believes it’s
her responsibility to protect the pearl housed in the Tower
of Glass for reasons that are her own.
Gritty Groff is hard to locate at any given moment, for she
lives in a mound of sand that migrates around the area. The
interior of her mound remains solid and constant, even as
it moves about the beach.
Beachcomber Kids (humans). Kenta, Kaz, and Kersh are
three kids who live on their own on the outskirts of the
village, making a living by combing the beach for valuable
miscellany that washes up on shore and selling them to
AHA or at the market in the village. When times are lean,
they’re not above pickpocketing. They have a small stash of
treasure in their lair—a ship buried in the sand.
Kersh, the oldest kid, is a warlock
who struck a bargain with a sea
spirit. He carries a globe of glass
in a mesh of rope at his hip,
which contains the
pufferfish spirit.

AHA maintains a semi-permanent encampment on the beach so its members can
monitor the stuff-on-shore phenomenon and
catalog the items.

The Courier Brigade maintains a small
outpost made of sand, though the resident
courier prefers to sleep in a tent behind the
modest building.

The Tall Hats witch coven passes through Tidewater from time to time, but they don’t have
any permanent presence here. Gritty Groff, the
sand witch, is unaffiliated with any coven.

Points of Interest

Adventure Hooks

Tower of Pearl and Glass. At the center of the village
stands its original marvel—the tall fulgurite tower that
holds the Pearl of Rongol. The tower’s twisting form juts
from the beach at an angle, looking like it’s going to topple
at any moment. Several branches splay out from the main
structure, giving the tower a silhouette that resembles a
deer’s antler. At its highest point, it looms thirty feet above
the sand.

Stolen Pearl. The adventurers awake to hubbub in the
center of Tidewater, where acolytes declare in ominous
tones that the Pearl of Rongol has gone missing. The only
clue is the large puddle in the inner sanctum, where the
pearl had been kept.

Within the tower, acolytes, using the technique of sand
sculpting, cut a network of chambers and tunnels that
branch from the original chamber of the pearl, which
formed when the tower first rose up around it. Though the
tower leans, it can be described as having three levels. The
bottom level contains the Chamber of Audience, a circular room with seating arranged around the edge. It’s where
people can come listen to the omenspeaker share what they
have seen in the pearl. A tunnel leads from the Chamber of
Audience to the acolytes’ quarters. These are modest lodgings, for the tower’s three acolytes. Another tunnel leads up
to the Vault of the Pearl. Though it was formed naturally,
the vault is a perfect three-sided pyramid. The pearl is kept
here on a bed of sand. Only acolytes are allowed here.
The four acolytes of the tower are:
◊ Ulmat the Omenspeaker—See NPCs above.
◊ Harraga (nonbinary human)—They are a blind healer
with a serious sweet tooth.
◊ Eol (male human)—He is burly and bald, and he frets
constantly about the cleanliness of the tower.
◊ Kem (female Nakudama)—She is loud and friendly, and
she is accompanied by a tiny black cat spirit named Boog.
Sculpture Park. The Tower of Pearl and Glass leans out
over the village’s sculpture garden, where sand sculptors
make marvelous works of art. The sculptures here depict
dramatic scenes from Obojiman myths and legends, or are
sprawling abstract displays meant to show off the artist’s
mastery. There’s a spirit who lurks in the sculpture park
who likes to animate the sculptures to scare passersby.
The sculptures are not meant to be permanent fixtures.
Like the village itself, the sculptures constantly rotate as
artists are struck by new inspiration. When a sculpture is
gone, it’s gone for good.
One corner of the Sculpture Park is reserved for Little
Obojima, a map of the island made entirely of sand.
Crab Caves. Tidewater’s beach is nestled in a cove hemmed
in by a crescent cliff that rises sharply from the sand. The
base of the cliff is dotted with caves, some of which lead
down to a waterlogged den of giant crabs. The crabs have
been domesticated by the villagers, though those who don’t
know the nuances of dealing with crabs might still run
afoul of their generally irritable disposition. From time to
time, adventurers are called upon to drive out monsters and
scavengers who’ve made lairs in the caves.

38

Trouble with Fleas. A sand sculpting contest is disrupted
by the burrowing of giant sand fleas. But it only happens
when certain sculptors are demonstrating their skill. Is it a
coincidence? Is it sabotage?
Kidnapped by Fish Folk. Three fishermen had gone out
on water early in the morning, but only one returned. He
was found unconscious in his boat, which had run aground
near the shore. The rudder showed bite marks. When he
regained consciousness, the fisherman revealed they were
attacked by fishfolk. The last thing he remembered before
being knocked out was seeing his comrades dragged overboard and down to the Shallows. He’s not sure how he
survived.
Washed Up. As the adventurers walk the beach, they come
across a pair of seagulls fighting over a corked, green glass
bottle. The birds screech and fly off at the adventurers’
approach, leaving the bottle resting on a bed of seaweed.
Within the bottle is a map to a rare ingredient of your choice.
See page 215 for more information about rare ingredients.

Legends
The Pearl is a Beacon. Most villagers agree that the Pearl
of Rongol can offer glimpses of coming events. But some
speculate that the pearl is also a beacon. According to the
legend, the pearl is calling out to something in the depths
of the ocean. Versions of the legend differ on whether or
not that something is benevolent.
Gift Giving Spirits. Some claim that the regularity with
which bits and bobs show up on Tidewater’s beaches is due
to coy water spirits who drag gifts onto the sand at night.
More than one late night beach walker has attested to hearing burbling giggles and chatter in the surf, but no one has
seen anything more than the waves lapping at the sand.

ULUWA
THE SPIRIT MARKET

S

uperimposed over an abandoned dockside fish market, is Uluwa, a bustling Spirit Realm town that attracts spirits of all
varieties who come to trade, gossip, and enjoy the revelry offered here. It is also a frequently used crossing for folk from
the Physical Realm to pass into the Spirit Realm, and it’s not uncommon to see them wandering wide-eyed through
Uluwa’s labyrinthine streets.

Tone/Vibe
Strange, Magical, Over the Top, Exciting

Reputation
Uluwa’s reputation is known to those who get specialty ingredients—especially spirit fish, which have a certain umami
flavor that is literally out of this world. It is also known as a
place where fun is to be had, as the Master of Ceremonies is
constantly inventing all kinds of events to keep the clients
pouring in, whether they be restaurateurs, epicureans, or
those who are simply seeking a fun, unique experience.

Entering Uluwa
Physical beings who wish to enter Uluwa must be invited by
a spirit or come by way of the Wandering Line or by the ferry
crossing. For the train or the ferry, adventurers must obtain a
special ticket that allows them to pass into the Spirit Realm.

Manic Market Maze
Once in Uluwa, adventurers are met with a riot of color,
movement, scents, and sounds. It is mainly a fish market,
with all kinds of spirit fish floating in schools overhead
and through the alleys of the market. Schools of fish swim
through the air as merchants and vendors call out their
wares and try to pull adventurers into their stalls to sample

39

their tasty delights. The Master of Ceremonies is always
about, advertising the latest specials and eagerly showing visitors around and giving them the grand tour of the
market (of which they are terribly proud).
There is no rhyme or reason to the layout of Uluwa,
which sprawls out from the original central market
square. The square is surrounded by stalls, some of which
are multiple stories tall, with stalls stacked atop one
another. Streets and alleyways branch out from here, zig
zagging between smaller squares, each one its own hub of
commerce. The town’s main street leads from the central
square down to the Bobbing Boat Market, where small fishing boats are lashed together—some of which are colorfully
lit and serve as floating stalls to sell even more wares.

Uluwa is a colorful, bustling place where a hundred different things always seem to be happening at once, and vendors all want passersby
to sample their wares—”the finest in market!”
As GM, communicating Uluwa’s over-the-top
atmosphere will help sell this location’s unique
identity, where folk from the Physical Realm will
likely feel overwhelmed by the frantic pace the
market seems to move at all the time.
In the game, Uluwa is a great way to showcase the
Spirit Realm as wondrous and fantastical, even
when compared to the Physical Realm of Obojima, which is itself, a magical place.

NPCs
Master of Ceremonies (spirit). Those who visit Uluwa are
sure to encounter the Master of Ceremonies, a tall, gangly,
dancing spirit with a warm, expressive face punctuated
by cartoonishly large eyebrows manicured to immaculate
points. He appears almost human-like, but his movements
and gesticulations have an uncanny, fluid quality that hints
at his boneless form. When the need arises, like when he
has to help multiple guests at once, he has been known to
part with his shadow and send it on errands.
He revels in his role as Uluwa’s welcome committee, and
he never sleeps. He fits right in with the general hubbub of
the market, and his voice can be heard booming out over
the din to announce the day’s catch at the Bobbing Boat
Market or to summon guests to, “Marvel at the fish paste
masters and their mighty mashers!”
Emille the Busker (male dara). Emille is a busker who
can usually be found on a street corner or on a rooftop
somewhere in Ulawa playing his one-of-a-kind stringed
instrument known as a pluckerine. The music he plays
matches the mood of his surroundings, but whether he
plays to the mood or sets it is not entirely known, such is
the enchanting quality of his craft. Emille came to Uluwa
looking for a music teacher, but his search carried him deep
into the Spirit Realm where he bound himself to a spirit in
exchange for musical talent. When he returned to Uluwa,
it was with his pluckerine in hand and unmatched skill to
play it. Though Emille is a relative newcomer to Uluwa, he is
already a fixture. Unknown to most, his playing is a compulsion that is a consequence of the pact he made with his
spirit patron. He is a melancholic figure who accepts his fate.
He is an excellent source of information, and he can also be
hired to play his magical tunes.
Throth With Eyes Everywhere (spirit). The market’s
constable is also one of the more bizarre residents of Uluwa.
Throth is a collective spirit entity made up of dozens of
floating eyes that spread out throughout streets to monitor for thieves and other ruffians. Despite its name, Throth
does not, in fact, have eyes everywhere, but it’s fine having
folks believe it to be true. When one of Throth’s eyes spots
a violation, it turns skyward and emits a powerful beam of
light, alerting Uluwa’s guards.

MASTER OF
CEREMONIES

Humble Utzu (spirit). This tiny spirit with a head
surrounded in magical black flame is one of Uluwa’s greatest smugglers and con artists. Utzu lives by the
axiom that everything and everyone has a price,
which means opportunity is around every
corner. The diminutive spirit knows how to
get just about anything, and if he doesn’t
know, he likely knows someone who does.
Utzu refers to itself in the third person,
always as “humble Utzu.” Finding Utzu is no
easy thing, though the spirit spends most of its
time in the Plaza of Lanterns.
HUMBLE UTZU

Vendors

Boat Market, where it will meet passengers ready to journey
back to the Physical Realm.

Below is a list of vendors you could include at the market.

Plaza of Lanterns. Generally, the Spirit Realm appears to
be in perpetual twilight, but in the Plaza of Lanterns, it’s
always night. Sparkling lanterns bob in the air, shedding
light that glitters off the scales of fish passing overhead. The
plaza has a reputation as a gathering place for schemers,
thieves, and others with ill intent in their hearts.

The Four Orbles. These small, identical, human-like spirits
are all-business fishmongers who specialize in catching fish
that float above Uluwa’s roofline in great schools. They are
each nimble tumblers, and they can be seen throughout
the market balancing on each other’s shoulders and leaping
high into the air to snare fish with their cartoonishly large
butterfly nets. They are known for their skill at catching
fish with magical properties. The Orbles have a stall in the
Bobbling Boat Market, where they sell their exotic catches.
Dapo Dapo! Fish Paste Masters. Dapo Dapo! are a duo of
spirits who are renowned fish paste mashers that make delicate pastes of a quality untasted in the physical world. The
gummy paste squeaks with glee when it is smashed with
the hammer. Both masters are named “Dapo” and when
they start hitting the paste they yell out, “Dapodapodapodapodapodapodapo!!!” They are singularly focused on their
craft, and are quite touchy about distractions,
especially unsolicited advice about making fish paste.
They’re local celebrities. Each Dapo secretly resents the
other’s talent.
Vymm and Vigor, Healers. Vymm is a healer who tends to
serve a more nefarious kind of patient: brawlers, cutpurses,
and adventurers. Vymm is a spirit with spider qualities,
who works her healing magic by cocooning her patients in
webbing that mends bones, closes wounds, and can even
leech poison from the body. She is assisted by a small rock
spirit named Vigor.

The Talls Hats witch coven usually has one or
more members in the village. They operate an
apothecary and fortune-telling kiosk in the
Plaza of Lanterns, and they help folks lost in
the Spirit Realm return home. Though they
are the only coven with a permanent presence
in Uluwa, other witches on their own errands
are common enough in the market.

Points of Interest
Ferry Crossing. Most folks enter Uluwa by way of the ferry.
The landing on the side of the river that’s in the Physical
Realm is a simple dock at the end of which is a wooden
statue of a giant gull with a fish in its mouth. Twice a day—
at dawn and dusk—the ferry arrives to carry passengers to
Uluwa. The ferryman is a broad-shouldered spirit that looks
like a stocky human, but without a head. It has a necklace
of fish, and when the ferryman speaks, it’s the fish heads
that do the talking. Only ticket holders are allowed to board
the ferry, and the ferryman is quick to toss anyone else into
the river.
On the Uluwa side of the river, frogs from the river gather
to guide the ferry into its spot at the end of the Bobbing

Let’s Have Another. They serve drinks here, but to call it
a tavern would not do it justice. The proprietor, a rotund,
mustachioed spirit with perpetual grin, lovingly refers to
his establishment as a “hall of joviality.” The place, located
at the edge of Uluwa, is always crowded, and entertainers
regularly play on the famous stage perched atop a pyramid
that dominates the center of the hall. What sets this place
apart from its counterparts in the Physical Realm is the fact
that patrons can enjoy a drink and meal at one of the many
tables set on the walls and ceiling, as the magic of the place
grants each surface its own gravity. It is recommended that
patrons indulge in the many sweet wines the establishment
has to offer.
Wandering Line Train Station. The rooftop train station
in Uluwa looks out over the central market plaza. Floating
remoras tend to swarm the train as it pulls into the station,
and some even latch onto unwary passengers who disembark here. For more about the Wandering Line, see page 113.

Adventure Hooks
Fish Hooks. Fisherfolk in the Spirit Realm are always on
the lookout for materials from the Physical Realm, especially finger bones which they carve into fish hooks and
lures. For some reason (whether it is true or merely spirit
folk superstition) fish in the Spirit Realm are greatly
attracted to finger bones from the Physical Realm.
Search for a Spirit Filet. Adventurers are given a mission
by a discerning chef in the Physical Realm to find a way into
Uluwa, locate a top-notch fishmonger, and procure a whole
psychic snapper from the Spirit Realm. It’s the only way to
create Farou’s Numinous Fish Fondue, a legendary dish that
is known only to the most ambitious chefs of Obojima.
Laying Low. The adventurers are enlisted to find a known
thief who fled from the Physical Realm into the Spirit Realm,
and who has been hiding out in Uluwa, likely in disguise.

Rumors and Legends
Original Crossing. Some believe Uluwa is the site where
mortals first entered the Spirit Realm.
Royal Prisoner. The Lionfish King once spent time as a
captive in Uluwa and therefore regards the village with
animosity. As the rumor goes, if he were to find a way
back to Uluwa, he would launch an all out attack as an act
of vengeance.

YATAMON
THE FIRST AGE CITY

N

ear the southern coast of the Gift of Shuritashi, lies the largest city in all of Obojima—Yatamon. Yatamon is a relic of
the First Age, a city that has existed before all written records, and is now home to around 10,000 people. Built on a
hillside overlooking the southern cliff faces that drop down into the sea, Yatamon is a city of tall houses, narrow alleyways, steep streets, rows of shops, and twisting staircases.
Yatamon is known to be a bustling city, full of interesting sights and delicious smells; where the unique technology of the
First Age such as bicycles, kei trucks, and vending machines can be found in abundance. Because of its reputation as a hub of
trade where everything is happening, young people tend to flock to Yatamon to join one of the factions, learn skills and crafts
from the resident masters, or to simply be in the thick of it and soak in the vibrancy of this magical city.
But despite Yatamon being the most populous city in Obojima, it is also a place of great mystery. The magic of the First Age
that keeps its millennia-old structures and artifacts in pristine condition is still unknown. The city is full of strange occurrences, unique enchantments, and ancient and peculiar spirits, which make the city as strange as one can find on the island.

Living In the of the
First Age
Most of the Obojimans who live in Yatamon are used to
the anachronistic strangeness of the First Age technology
and architecture, which has now become “home” to them.
Kids play in the streets and climb on the walls and rooftops, neighborhood cats and dogs roam the alleyways and

sit on garden fences, all of which look like they had been
built years ago, but, in reality, they have existed this way
for thousands of years.
Yatamon is also filled with the sounds of First Age technology, brought to life by spirits and magics that provide
the energy for them to work again. The occasional kei
truck whizzing by, the metallic rumble of a trolley car, or
the scratchy tune of a record player are all sounds a city
dweller may hear every day while staying in Yatamon. To an
outsider, seeing and hearing these bizarre machines might
be delightful, alarming, or bewildering at first but that is
part of the personality of Yatamon—it is a unique place that
moves at a much faster pace than the rest of Obojima.

City Magic
Because of the city’s potent enchantments, those who live
in Yatamon long enough begin to develop magic of their
own, usually in the form of a cantrip. Many witches theorize that the reason is because the city seems to “know”
what its residents need and, through some unknown power
of the First Age, it provides a spell to help them. For example, a baker or blacksmith may suddenly gain the ability to
control flames to help them in their work; an enterprising
florist may wake up one morning with the ability to entice
flowers to grow or a hard-working gardener may, through a
powerful dream, learn how to mold earth.

Who Runs Yatamon?
Despite its size, there’s no single leader and no official
governance. Because of the nature of First Age magic, all the

city’s municipal functions—plumbing, sanitation, running
water—magically work so there’s no need for groups of
people to worry about it. Small spirits love to light the
streets at night, to power the neon signs, and light paper
lanterns, so even lighting is taken care of by the strange
magic of the First Age.
What Yatamon does have by way of leadership are influential people, and all of them care about Yatamon and
their neighbors in their different ways, but one thing they
all agree on is to keep the city from expanding. Preserving
Yatamon’s unique First Age look is to honor both the historical and traditional value of this place—and perhaps to not
disturb or insult the unknown power that gives all First Age
sites their incorruptible nature.

A Hub of Trade
Yatamon is a haggler’s paradise. Among its many qualities, the city is known to have streets lined with shops and
makeshift stalls, but the main area for trade is the central
plaza, which hosts an open-air market every day. At night,
merrymakers and shoppers flock to Fire Snake Alley, a
long, narrow, winding street that is festooned with colorful
lanterns and lights, where performers, street food, and all
manner of oddities can be found.
Although copper buds, sea petals, and dawn flowers are
the main currency, shopkeepers in Yatamon are always
happy to barter for specific items. Witches and foragers deal
in potion ingredients, while scavengers and scrappers trade
their First Age wares to merchants who deal in ancient tech.

Vending Heaven
Being a relic of the First Age, Yatamon has the highest
concentration of vending machines in all of Obojima, in
fact, there are more vending machines here than perhaps
all of the island. Because humans have lived here for centuries, all known vending machines have been claimed by
wizards or spirits who sell or barter their wares for buds,
flowers, petals, or other types of trade. Vending machines
can contain anything from potion ingredients to strange
items to snacks and drinks—whatever a wizard wants to put
inside—but there are some vending machines that are as
yet undiscovered, and they have items within them that are
often from the time of the Nakudama or even the First Age.

Under the City
Because Yatamon’s inner workings are all magically taken
care of, few ever find the need to go underneath the city
to inspect its sewers, drainage pipes, or access tunnels.
But, invariably, people go underneath the city—perhaps to
rescue an errant kitten or to recover a ring that was fumbled
through a gutter grate, not to mention curious kids who
can’t resist a secret hideout.
But the deeper under the city an adventurer goes, the
more dangerous it becomes as the concentrated magic of
the First Age draws all manner of strange beasts and spirit
aberrations to bathe in its arcane energies.

NPCs
Dr. Zalia Frond and Krocius (female human and male
Nakudama). Dr. Frond is an AHA archaeologist who is
working on excavating the undercity of Yatamon, specifically to study the mysteries of the First Age. Dr. Frond is an
affable and enthusiastic scholar who is excited about discovering more about Obojima’s ancient past.
Krocius is a slender, reserved, and soft-spoken Nakudama
who claims to be a scholar of the Second Age. Krocius
prefers to let Dr. Frond do all the talking, quietly listening
and occasionally nodding in assent. In reality, Krocius is
using Dr. Frond and AHA to delve deeper into areas that
are more and more dangerous in an effort to uncover
some clue as to the lost prison of the ancient Nakudama
emperor, Oghmai.
Cholly (spirit). Cholly is a pelican spirit who acts as the
conductor of the trolley car that serves Yatamon. As people
board the trolley car, they toss money into Cholly’s giant
beak for fare. Cholly punches tickets and serves snacks, all
while powering the trolley car, a feat most spirits claim to
be quite impressive. Cholly is a scatterbrain but he is very
enthusiastic about his job and loves to chatter with
his patrons as the trolly rattles up and down the steep
city streets.
Granny Yuzu (female human). If adventurers begin to
ask around Yatamon for First Age relics, they will eventually

44

hear the name, Granny Yuzu. Granny Yuzu lives in a small
house surrounded by yuzu trees. Inside her house are all
kinds of First Age items that Granny simply enjoys collecting as room and wall decor. She doesn’t like to sell her
treasures, but she may take a liking to someone and, if they
ask nicely or offer her something she likes such as a lawn
gnome or a painting of a cottage in the woods, then she may
give up one of her trinkets. Should anyone wish to steal any
of Granny Yuzu’s First Age treasures or trouble her in any
way, Tibor, Granny’s spirit mastiff, is prepared to unleash a
tsunami of violence at the drop of a hat.
Gomber and Beeks, Private Eyes (male human and
spirit). Gomber is a private eye and Beeks is his paunchy,
humanoid bird spirit sidekick, together comprising the
crime-fighting duo of Gomber and Beeks. Gomber is a
hard-boiled, straight-shooting detective and Beeks pretty
much just says, “Beek!” But Gomber understands his friend
completely and seems to glean lots of information from
a single “beek” to a frantic series of “beeks” from Beeks.
Gomber and Beeks are officially part of the Courier Brigade,
helping the faction track down mail fraud, apprehend package thieves, and thwart any kind of skullduggery that goes
on within the city limits of Yatamon.
Tatsu and the Goro Goros (male human). Tatsu is the
leader of a gang of miscreant youths who go around the city
doing mostly harmless acts of vandalism. Tatsu talks a big
talk and is followed by a scroungy-looking cast of youths
who either fear Tatsu or idolize him. This rag-tag group goes
by the Goro Goros, and they’re known for “magic tagging”
where they paint their gang’s symbol—a grinning goro
goro—on houses, walls, shops, and other areas of the city,
irritating the local merchants and residents. These images
are made with magic ink from the pigment potion and can
be incredibly difficult to remove.
One of the Goro Goros is a Young Steward, Mikiko
(female human), who is a budding witch and who knows
how to find the ingredients and make the pigment potion.
Mikiko feels bad about what she and the gang are doing,
but she desperately wants to fit in and thinks Tatsu is
totally cool.
Imelda (female elf). Imelda is a thief who can find
anything thanks to the discerning nose of her spirit
companion, Choofi. Choofi is a floating, fur-covered spirit
with a special sniffer that can discern what any object is by
smell alone. Imelda moonlights as a package thief, sneaking up to an unattended Courier Brigade postal wagon and
sending Choofi to snuffle through it. If Choofi smells something expensive, Imelda is not above stealing the package
and then selling it to the highest bidder.
The more success Imelda gets using Choofi’s magic nose,
the more audacious she becomes. She’s now designed her
own calling card that she leaves at the scene of her crimes.
Master Hu (male human). Master Hu is a baker and the
creator of the Happy Joy Cake. Master Hu is not only a firstrate baker but he is also a kind of a guru, his most famous
quote being, “As with all things, look to the cake and the

answer will come”. Master Hu is an entertaining personality
who is earnest in his love for making Happy Joy Cakes.
Like he says, “I put a bit of love and First Age magic into
every one!”
Postmaster Miranda Escalante (female human).
Miranda Escalante is the current Postmaster of the Courier
Brigade’s Yatamon office, and is Postmaster General Drubal’s
right hand. Miranda oversees the training of every knight
in the brigade, making sure that the recruits understand
and respect their oath to the postal corps and are fully
prepared for the challenges and trials ahead. She’s generally
very honest and forthcoming and, when she can, tries to
make a good effort in helping those around her.
Mr. Basingstoke (male human). To ensure non-partiality, the Witchery (see the Witchery in the factions
section below) is run by a warlock, Mr. Basingstoke,
who is purposely not affiliated with any of the covens.
Mr. Basingstoke is an intimidating man who runs the
Witchery with austere efficiency. Mr. Basingstoke’s spirit
companion is a large disturbing octopus creature called
“Sorrow”. Sorrow moves in total silence, observing everything through its colorless eyes as it drifts down hallways
and floats through walls, and, because of this, Sorrow
has the unsettling habit of appearing suddenly and startling everyone in the room. Even though Sorrow’s face is
without expression, Mr. Basingstoke will often remark on
how Sorrow is feeling, saying, “Sorrow is quite displeased
with you today” or “Sorrow thinks that you
should reconsider”. Many of the witches at
the Witchery speculate if Mr. Basingstoke
is just having fun or if Sorrow
does indeed have feelings, whatever the case may be, Sorrow’s
silent and ominous demeanor
never betrays a single
hint of emotion.

MR. BASINGSTOKE

Factions
AHA
Although AHA’s headquarters reside east
of Yatamon in the Coastal Highlands, the
city does house the organization’s second
largest outpost, which resides inside of
a First Age library. The stacks, where hundreds of books
used to be, are now filled with AHA research papers and
equipment. Drawers, where Dewey decimal cards were once
stored now, hold samples taken from the various sites that
AHA is studying all over the island. Here in Yatamon, AHA
members are studying the First Age in depth, as opportunity is abundant in the city. There are about 20 AHA
members who work at the library outpost around the clock,
one of them is Mortimus Fids (human male), the head
curator of this AHA office. Mortimus rules the AHA office
with a sense of self-importance and snobbery that makes
everyone loathe the sound of his voice. If Mortimus senses
even the slightest bit that a piece of information he has is
of significance to the adventurers, he will make them go
through all manner of hoop jumping, ego-stroking, and
groveling before letting it go.
AHA Underground Expedition. Because of their interest in history, especially the giant mystery of the First
Age, AHA has an ongoing archaeological dig led by Dr.
Zalia Frond and her Nakudama colleague, Krocius, that has
recently gone down into the sublayers of Yatamon to see if
they can unearth more secrets of the First Age.

The Courier Brigade
Yatamon is where the Courier Brigade has
its main headquarters. Housed in what
was once a First Age bank, the Courier
Brigade uses the vault to safely store their
packages, and a row of tellers take the packages to be delivered either locally or abroad. On the roof is a large landing
pad where the famous “flying lantern” is moored—it’s always
a major attraction for the city of Yatamon when the lantern
lands or takes off from the Courier Brigade headquarters.
The Courier Brigade has its own
training ground here where they train
their recruits in all the skills needed
to deliver the mail and become a
proper postal knight, whether it be
riding on horseback, running on foot,
or piloting one of the giant lanterns.
COURIER BRIGADE
POSTAL BOX

The Witch Covens
All of the witch covens have a circle or
sanctum here, each one with its own special
symbol emblazoned in some fashion outside
to let those in the coven know where they
can find refuge and commune.
The Witchery. In Yatamon, the covens have come together
to create an academy known as the Witchery, where budding
witches can come to train in the basics and then choose
which coven they would like to join. Located in an ancient
First Age movie theater, the Witchery has elder witches
from each coven who teach the hopefuls and see if there are
any who best suit their particular coven. As a main focus
for their studies, the Witchery’s aim is to try and teach the
basics of magic and how to incorporate First Age objects
into spells.

Points of Interest
The Beehive. The Beehive is a kind of inn that is essentially
a wall of hexagonal holes where people who are recovering
from a hard night’s drinking, are down on their luck, or are
just passing through can stay for free. There are around 50
capsules along a twisting alley that are available on a firstcome-first-served basis. If an adventurer is looking to find
someone who doesn’t want to be found, chances are they are
staying at the Beehive.
Happy Joy Cake Bakery. If asked, most visitors to Yatamon
say they are here to see the Happy Joy Cake Bakery where
Obojima’s most favored delicacy, the original Happy Joy Cake,
has been made with love and magic for the past 50 years or
more. The bakery is on the eastern side of the city and if an
adventurer has a nose and sense of smell, they can find it
simply by following the most delicious pastry scent they can
imagine back to its source. The bakery’s tour guide, a jolly
chicken spirit named Bokka Bokka, is always ready to give
anyone a tour of the bakery and hand out some free samples,
and while on the tour, they might even meet Master Hu and
watch him make a Happy Joy Cake by hand.
Lula’s Spirit Diner and Gambling Hall. When residents of
Yatamon want the best in traditional spirit cuisine, they all
head to Lula’s, and, if they are feeling lucky, they can head
into the large back room where there are multiple tables,
each one with a few of the regulars playing all their favorite
spirit games around the clock.
Lula is one of the rare spirits that can freely go to and
from the Spirit Realm without needing a portal, so she has
all of her drinks and ingredients stored there allowing her to
effectively double the space of her establishment and serve
her customers in a flash. Lula has heard stories of just about
everything while serving in her diner, and word on the street
is that she has been in Yatamon for centuries, some say even
as early as the Age of Humanity.
Bridge Cat. Underneath one of Yatamon’s largest stone
bridges sleeps a giant spirit known as Bridge Cat. Bridge Cat

46

has been here as long as anyone in Yatamon can remember,
snoring away in what seems to be an eternal slumber. Every
now and then, Bridge Cat may twitch an ear or yawn or
shift positions. Sometimes when it yawns, it disappears into
the Spirit Realm or when it exhales it momentarily becomes
transparent. Apart from these slight variations, Bridge Cat
never moves from this spot. Little kids can often be found
playing on Bridge Cat and people from Yatamon come to rub
Bridge Cat’s belly for good luck and leave offerings and gifts
for the spirit as it is said to bring longevity and a peaceful
life. Every resident of Yatamon has opinions about Bridge
Cat—why it is sleeping there and what it might mean if it
ever wakes up—but no one really knows for certain, leaving
Bridge Cat another one of Obojima’s enduring mysteries.
Dappa’s Bicycle Alley. Down one of Yatamon’s twisting
side streets is Dappa’s Bicycle Alley, the premier place in
all of Obojima that deals in these magnificent, mechanical
contraptions of the First Age. Dappa’s Bicycle Alley is run by
an energetic Nakudama named Dappa, who has been helping Obojimans experience the joys of two-wheeled transport
ever since he first rode one years ago. Here, an adventurer
can rent or buy a bicycle or moped—some of which have
already been enchanted for those who wish to ride without
effort through the city.
Through the use of magic and spirits under his employment, Dappa is even known to send bicycles meandering
about the city as two-wheeled taxis, actively looking for
customers to transport.
Gojo’s Ramen Bucket. Gojo and his gang of ramen goons
run Yatmon’s premier ramen shop known as Gojo’s Ramen
Bucket. Even though Gojo’s shop has its fair share of return
customers, it has lived in the shadow of Hakumon’s legendary ramen shop for as long as they have been open. Gojo
secretly admires Hakumon at the same time, but he resents
being second best and can’t get over it. Gojo’s desire to be
seen as the greatest ramen chef ever is a source of constant
irritation for him and he is fed up with Hakumon winning
every festival. Now, it’s a matter of wounded pride and Gojo
is prepared to do almost anything to win.
Himitsu’s Arcane Izakaya. Himitsu’s Arcane Izakaya is
a tavern that is tucked away down a dark alley lit by red
lanterns. Himitsu’s is primarily a tavern for spirits, so it
vanishes during the day and is simply a stone wall, but to
accommodate its physical guests, Himitsu’s appears at dusk,
just as the lanterns are lit, already filled with a colorful cast
of spirit regulars.
Himitsu is a spirit who runs the izakaya and is known to
have the unique ability to alter their form.
Behind the bar, there’s a secret door that leads to another
part of Himitsu’s Arcane Izakaya, but this area is accessible “by invitation only”. Should an adventurer be granted
the password, they are taken through a thick wooden door,
down a flight of stone stairs, into the basement where there
are a number of stand-up arcade video games. There are
a few of them that are homes to spirits, and those bathe
the room with the colorful flicker of their cathode ray tube

Adventure Hooks
displays. The arcade games are considered to have strange
magic within them. If a spirit whelms one of the dormant
arcade games, they suddenly pop into life and some may
transmit a cryptic message.

A Witch in Need. A young witch needs to find her broom
that flew off into the nearby woods and she desperately
needs it to deliver the “special parcel” that she had tied to
it. The special parcel was given to her by a “strange spirit”
and she was to deliver it to Yatamon’s clockmaker.

Himitsu says that they believe these artifacts from the
First Age may have things to teach us—wisdom that is
useful to our present times.

If found, the parcel contains a complex and magic clockwork device that needs to be properly reassembled before it
will function again, whatever that function may be.

The Gap. There’s an alleyway that dead ends into a stone
wall with a long crack going through it. This place is known
as “the Gap” by Yatamon locals and it is a known portal to
the Spirit Realm. Due to their ability to be insubstantial,
spirits can ooze through the Gap and reform in the Physical Realm, so spirits can be seen entering and exiting the
Gap as they transition between the realms. Because of the
Gap, Yatamon is one of the most well-known cities in the
Spirit Realm, and there are more than a few “spirit tourists”
coming here to enjoy all the delights the Physical Realm has
to offer.

Trouble Brewing. An AHA ranger has come into town and
is drawing a crowd by holding a jar of Corruption aloft and
imploring everyone to pay attention and to beware because
the Corruption is coming to Yatamon. The local town elders
are displeased with the hubbub and don’t like someone
scaring townsfolk with these wild claims of Corruption and
spreading their “doomsaying” about.

Jenni’s General Store. Jenni is a human witch whose
general store is Yatamon’s hub for selling and buying potion
ingredients. She has two little brothers, Hop and Jib, who
she bosses around to get the shelves stocked and to run
deliveries, which they do on their dilapidated motorcycle.
Jenni is kind, helpful, and she simply adores adventurers
and adventuring. She is very responsible, but if there was
anything that would take her away from her duties running
the store, it would be going on an epic adventure!
The Ancient Subway. There is an old subway system that
may have at one time linked to terminals all across the
island, but now the station lies dormant and the tunnels
that lead out from under the city have long since collapsed.

If approached, the AHA ranger will beseech any adventurers for help and will mention the plight of Polewater (see
“Polewater” below). If there are any corrupted rangers in the
party, the Corruption in the jar will suddenly be drawn to
them, as if pulled by a magnet, and at the same time, their
corrupted wounds will begin to throb painfully.
A Vocal Dilemma. Whiskers, a caramel-colored spirit cat,
has lost his voice to a witch named Meg Wicklowe and can
now only meow. With Meg long since gone from Yatamon,
Whiskers now must find a chattershroom—a special kind of
mushroom that can get his voice back—but the only place
to find them around here is in the city sewer system, and
Whiskers knows that going down there is a bad idea for a
spirit cat as there are too many dangerous things looking for
an easy meal. Whiskers’ only hope is to find some adventurers willing to get a chattershroom for him—but how can he
ask any when all he can do is meow?

THE LAND OF HOT WATER
Between Mount Arbora’s northern and eastern slopes and the sea lies the Land of Hot Water. This arid expanse is dotted
with natural hot springs, boiling pools, and towering geysers, with mineral-rich earth painting the landscape in vivid reds
and yellows.
The inhabitants here have forged a unique culture that combines industry with relaxation. They harness the geothermal
energy to power their forges and heat their homes, while also indulging in the soothing hot springs and saunas. Recently, a
fascination with flight has surged among their inventive tinkerers, who draw inspiration from the soaring birds, geysers, and
thermal updrafts to craft all manner of flying machines.
The coastal waters around the Land of Hot Water are warmed by underwater vents, creating a haven for exotic marine life,
from glowing fish to fearsome sea serpents. The people regard these creatures with both awe and caution—respect for the
land’s volatile nature.
The residents of this region have a worldview shaped by the destructive and life-giving forces of this environment, which
results in them often seeing things in a more dualistic fashion—yet another way this fiery, mountainous land shapes the art
and philosophy of those who live within it.

CHISUAY’S TEAHOUSE

W

hen following the Mosspot path up into the foothills of Mount Arbora, you’ll arrive at Chisuay’s Teahouse—an
Obojiman Staple, run by the charismatic and eclectic tea master of the same name.

Chisuay’s Teahouse is fairly well-known throughout Obojima, even merchants in distant villages sell some of
Chisuay’s heirloom teas. Each of Chisuay’s delicious, fragrant, and refreshing varieties comes in its own unique and beautifully wrapped package. Many Obojiman households have a package of Chisuay’s most famous blend known as Chisuay’s
Heavenly Tea. Obojimans love tea and will happily describe their favorite blend, talking at great length about its beneficial
effects. A few tea lovers could point out the location of the teahouse on a map and there might be a handful of true aficionados who have personally made the pilgrimage, and those who have gush with rave reviews of the teahouse and Chisuay’s
hallmark charm.

Tone/Vibe
Relaxing, Elegant, Curated, an Experience

Visiting the Teahouse
The grounds that surround the teahouse are the perfect
compliment to Chisuay’s soothing tea blends. Those that
approach the teahouse during the daytime, will hear the
bees and instantly smell the adjacent herb garden with
its network of pebble stone paths that twist and meander
through a host of sweet and exotic smelling herbs, flowers,
and spices. A clear stream runs next to the teahouse provid-

ing fresh, cool water for all Chisuay’s offerings—as Chisuay
says, “The water is the soul of the tea.”
At night time, the teahouse and grounds are no less
stunning, lit up with scores of paper lanterns and a host of
fireflies that dance among the trees.

Teahouse Interior
The tea shop’s interior is just as breathtaking as its exterior. During the day, the sliding doors and windows are
kept open, allowing the rays of sunlight to illuminate and
bolster the warm tones of the wood floor, highlighting intricately embroidered silk tablecloths and Jacquard furniture.

49

At night, the sun’s light is replaced by the dull glow of a
hundred burning butterflies, which drift and flutter near
the top of the tall, arched ceiling.

The Tea House &
Its Service
Chisuay can usually be found in the main room of the
house, paying close attention to every customer, telling
stories of how he acquired his knowledge of tea, and regaling customers with a litany of frightfully witty anecdotes.
Behind a long wood bar made of a single mahogany plank
is Migo (see below), Chisuay’s six-armed spirit companion.
When Chisuay takes an order from a customer, he calls out
a recipe, and Migo’s six arms go swiftly to work, pulling
ingredients from the wall behind the bar filled with jars
and drawers of different kinds of tea, herbs, and spices.
Migo then either expertly wraps these ingredients in beautifully colored paper or he gives them to Chisuay in a tea
sachet along with a cup, saucer, pot of hot water, and an
assortment of biscuits. Chisuay then serves the customer
their own personal blend of tea with dashing and
sophisticated flair.

NPCs
Chisuay, The Tea Master (male human). The proprietor,
Chisuay (use the mage or oni stat block depending on what
guise Chisuay is in), is a slender and dashing oni sorcerer
who, has spent over a decade earning his title, Tea Master.
Chisuay is very charismatic and a tad pompous at times, but
he knows how to work a crowd, entertaining all who enter
his teahouse.
When he isn’t tending to customers or going over his
inventory, Chisuay can be found tending to his expansive
herb garden and tea plants. Chisuay knows almost everything there is to know about tea and its properties (or as he
says, “proper teas”).
In the Know. Chisuay seems to befriend everyone who is
anyone on the island of Obojima. For adventurers, one of
his favorite referrals is the herbalist healer, Adira, who runs
the apothecary at Hogstone Hot Springs as she is Chisuay’s
go-to person for healing wounds and ailments from poisons
to curses.
The Dark Secret. Despite his affable exterior, Chisuay has
a secret—his oni side—that he never lets anyone see. In his
quiet moments, away from the chatter and laughter of his
customers, Chisuay wrestles with his urges that tempt him
to fully embrace his oni powers. A struggle he’s dealt with
his entire life and one that would later divide him and his
older brother Hakumon, the master ramen chef.

50

CHISUAY

How you play Chisuay and his oni nature can be
done in a number of ways, but here are two:
A Dashing Scamp. You can play Chisuay as a
good guy whose oni nature is more mischievous
and naughty than dangerous and evil. He’s
quirky and rambunctious—it’s what makes
him fun to be around!
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. You can make Chisuay
kind at heart and trying his best to keep his oni
nature under wraps. But every now and then it
slips out and wreaks havoc and his entire staff is
trained to keep it all under wraps.

Migo (spirit). Migo is a companion spirit who helps
Chisuay run the teahouse. Migo can produce many arms
that stretch and contract from his cylindrical torso, allowing
him to pull tea and herbs off the towering shelves and package them for customers.
Migo doesn’t speak but nods or uses sign language that
only Chisuay seems to comprehend. Migo can also tell when
Chisuay is grappling with his oni side and is quick to help
usher Chisuay away in dire circumstances.
Indigo & the Fosa Helpers. Chisuay’s serving staff are a
group of awakened fossa that Chisuay discovered wandering
the mountainside several years ago. They’re well mannered
and even better dressed, which makes them the ideal team
to help to serve the customers, keep the grounds clean,
and take care of the tea gardens. Leading the staff as the
self-appointed majordomo, is Indigo, a stuffy and somewhat
self-important fossa, who pushes his weight around when
Chisuay isn’t at the teahouse.

INDIGO AND
FOSA HELPERS

The door to Hakumon’s old shop is not only expertly
barricaded through magic, it’s also constantly watched by a
group of Chisuay’s spirit helpers. They make sure that any
nosy guests are directed back into the teashop.
Should an adventurer get past Chisuay’s guards and
inspect the sealed door, a success on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check reveals a collection of wards and seals. The
first of which are several Iron Seals, placed by a waxwork
rogue. To open the door a creature must first succeed a DC
16 Strength (Athletics) check. If the Iron Seals are broken,
a secondary seal triggers a sleep spell cast at 5th level. If an
adventurer gets inside, the room is kept immaculate and
frozen in time, as if Chisuay is keeping it pristine for the
day when his brother returns.

Adventure Hooks
The Green Teapot. During a visit to the teahouse, the
adventurers are served a hot pot of tea in an ornately crafted,
green ceramic teapot. When Chisuay’s back is turned, the
teapot whispers to one of the party members and claims
that it’s a wizard named Sallifas who has been trapped in
the teapot by Chisuay. Sallifas quickly begs to be released by
breaking a curse that is on the teapot. When Chisuay notices
that the teapot was used to serve guests, he quickly switches
the teapots with a disarming grin, saying that this teapot is
rather naughty. The green teapot is never seen again.
Strange Brew. In a hidden section of Chisuay’s Teahouse
there is a magically sealed lock box that contains notes and
experiments on a recipe for a tea known as “Nightmare
Tea”. This recipe is written in a handwriting that is unlike
Chisuay’s flowing script because it is written by Chisuay
when he’s in his oni form. By reading the notes thoroughly
(1 hour of study) and making a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, an adventurer can surmise the following:
◊ “Nightmare Tea” is a potion designed to give whoever
drinks it a series of nightmarish dreams from which they
cannot wake until the sun rises.
◊ The spell requires a blend of special teas and herbs
brewed in an enchanted teapot.
◊ Anyone drinking Nightmare Tea loses 1 permanent
point of Constitution but gains 1 permanent point
of Intelligence.

Points of Interest
Hakumon’s Old Ramen Shop. If an adventurer inspects
the back side of the tea house, they can see evidence of an
entrance to a shopfront that has now been sealed off by
numerous magical glyphs and waxwork seals. This was once
the entrance to Hakumon’s old ramen shop, long ago when
he and Chisuay were planning on working together.

Room of Repose. Up a flight of wooden stairs and across
a landing that overlooks the main room, there’s a wooden
double door that leads to the Room of Repose. This room is
elegantly furnished with carved wooden tables, comfortable
chairs, and sofas. There are windows with sheer curtains
that overlook the herb garden and stream, and there are
several wooden shelves filled with all manner of curios.
Every morning, fresh flowers are brought to the room by
Chisuay’s spirit helpers, as well as silver trays of confections
and an assortment of the day’s fresh-baked pastries.
The Room of Repose is used for guests of honor and
clients who want that extra bit of ambiance, privacy,
and sophistication.
Chisuay’s Patisserie Delights. To the left of the mahogany
bar is an assortment of pastries from choux to filo to puff
and shortcrust. Every morning, the counter is covered with
an exquisite array of petit-fours, croissants, eclairs, tarts,
and strudels, but the one that people come from all over
to sample is a flavor of Happy Joy Cake that is only served
here—Chisuay’s Elegant Tea Cake. Chisuay is very proud
of this honor and cannot help but find a casual way to
bring up his friendship with the renowned cake maker and
creator of the Happy Joy Cake, Master Hu.

Legends and Rumors
The few that are aware of Chisauy and Hakumon’s kinship
can only speculate about the split between them. What is
known is that it happened long ago. While they worked in
a single shop exploring their culinary arts, they were also
sorcerers who pursued the unstable power of the oni. As
their magic power grew, so did the gravity of their choice—
would they embrace their emerging oni natures, and if they
did, would they be able to contain the oni’s power and thirst
for mayhem? Or would they turn away from the promise of
power and only dream of the magic and monstrous might
that lay just beyond the veil of their fragile humanity?
Whatever happened, Chisuay chose to remain in human
form and Hakumon can no longer disguise his oni nature,
and both of them do not speak of the other.

COASTAL DIVERS’ LODGE

T

NORTHERN BRANCH

he Mariners’ Guild in the Land of Hot Water operates out of Pelican’s Nest Lighthouse, a long-derelict structure the
guild refurbished and continues to maintain. The northern branch was first of the four lodges that the guild established
decades ago and in the guild’s heyday, it served as headquarters and primary residence of the guild’s leader, the maritime adventurer, Captain Clintock. But that was many years ago now, and as enthusiasm for the guild’s efforts waned so did
the support. Now, the northern lodge remains one of only two left in use.
The lodge is located just off the coastline that hugs Sky Kite Valley on a rocky spit of land that juts northward into the sea
from the cliffs. Travelers from the town used to frequent the lodge, and the Mariners’ Guild had plans to expand the facility.
The crumbling remains of several partially built additions and out buildings are all that remain of these grand ambitions.

The Clintock Family
Captain Clintock, his wife Kara, and their two daughters
Paloma and Holly were known throughout Obojima as
the first family of adventure. But that was about ten years
ago. Though their fame has since waned, the family name
continues to loom large among maritime enthusiasts, and
it remains a fixture within the divers’ lodges. It’s doubly
true of the northern branch, which is where they resided
together as family until Kara died. Several years ago,
Paloma, the older daughter, took over management of the
southern divers’ lodge.

52

Though the captain technically resides at this branch,
he prefers to stay at sea aboard his submarine, the Pointue.
It therefore falls to Holly, gifted engineer and shipwright,
to oversee the lodge today. Together with her father, she
is famous for advancing efforts to explore the underwater
realm. For her part, Holly is responsible for developing new
technology including diving suits, and most notably, her
father’s current incarnation of the Pointue.

Tone/Vibe
Empty, Disorganized, Friendly, Helpful
HOLLY
CLINTOCK

The northern branch of the Mariners’ Guild is
the best place to get outfitted for anyone interested in venturing beneath the sea, as Holly is eager
to have folks test out her experimental gear.
The lodge, therefore makes a good homebase for
seagoing adventures. In fact, it is featured in the
Below the Shallows adventure, which is included
in this book (see page 351).
The lodge is most closely linked to the southern
branch of the Mariners’ Guild (see page 24) and
nearby Sky Kite Valley (see page 58).

Happenings at
the Lodge
The lodge is associated with two of Obojima’s unfolding
sources of conflict—the Corruption and the Lionfish
King’s aggression.

The Pointue Stranded
Though Holly is at work on a dozen or so different projects
at any given time, her father’s submersible is always front
of mind. The current incarnation is her design, and she’s
tinkering with it, adding improvements and modifications
every time the vessel returns to the lodge. Of late, her
thoughts have been on the Pointue’s latest expedition, in
which Captain Clintock voyaged to investigate the Corruption on the east side of the island. On that trip, the Pointue
was damaged, and belligerent fishfolk blocked him from
returning to the northern lodge.
Holly is now furiously working on a patch for the hull,
but is missing a few key materials. Furthermore, she can’t
even begin to work on the Pointue until her father figures
out a way to bring the submersible to the northern lodge.

NPCs
Holly Clintock (female human). The younger daughter
of Captain Clintock is a gifted engineer and fabricator, and
head of the lodge. Her optimistic nature and general sense
of wonder draw comparisons to her father from some of
the old-timers who visit the Mariners’ Guild. She regards
such comments warmly, for she loves her father, and she
inherited his fascination with the sea. Her sister, Paloma,
however, is an enigma to Holly, and while their relationship

isn’t necessarily strained, there is little affection between
them. Holly takes some blame for this because relationships
tend to exasperate her, and she prefers heads-down work
in her workshop. Anyone listening carefully while Holly is
working might hear her talking to her tools as though they
were old friends.
Marcel, the Lighthouse Keeper (male human). Marcel
has been the lighthouse keeper since the Mariners’ Guild
took over the building. He is broad-shouldered and tall,
with a thick mustache and thick arms that feature tattoos of
mythical marine life. Several years ago, Marcel lost his sight,
but Holly modified a First Age fish finder that uses sonar
to help him navigate the lighthouse tower and see to his
duties. Holly regards Marcel as family and, though the gruff
old man won’t admit it, the feeling is mutual.
Marcel has a companion spirit that takes the form of a
pelican. Its name is Disaster, and it’s a prideful being who
claims that the Pelican’s Nest Lighthouse was named for it.
Captain Clintock (male human). If the captain has
any permanent residence beyond the walls of his prized
submersible, it’s here in the northern Coastal Divers’ Lodge.
Of late, however, he is stranded in the south. For more on
him, see the section on the Coastal Divers’ Lodge, Southern
Branch on page 24.

Points of Interest
Holly’s Workshop. Anyone entering the lodge through the
main entrance will find themselves in the middle of Holly’s
workshop. This round room is crowded with several workbenches at one end, each one covered in tools, schematics,

53

and scale models of ships. The other end of the workshop is
where large-scale projects are put together and tested. The
back of the workshop has two heavy metal doors that open
onto the sea when they are slid apart. A large winch is used
to carry heavy materials to and from the water.
Holly’s workshop is where one is likely to find Holly and
her most recent projects.
Kara’s Studio. When the Clintock family made their home
at the lodge, Holly’s mother, Kara, had a dedicated studio
on the second floor where she made her art and wrote
her popular comic, Ava and the Allstars. After she died, the
studio was left unchanged as a tribute to her. The room is
filled with original comic book pages and Ava memorabilia.
The door to this room is typically kept locked, though Holly
likes to spend time here occasionally.
The Clintock Collection. A spiral staircase ascends from
the second floor of the lighthouse up to the beacon. Anyone
who climbs the stairs will find all kinds of treasures and
curiosities on display on the circular inner wall of the lighthouse. Known as the Clintock collection, it features things
pulled up from the sea on the many voyages of the Pointue.
A few noteworthy pieces include a mysterious fish skull
that has a ghostly light glowing in one of its eye sockets, an
enormous sword far too big for any person to carry, and the
dorsal fin of the original Pointue.
The Beacon. The pinnacle of the lighthouse is called the
Beacon, and it’s where the lantern and lens are kept. A
parapet encloses a wide deck, which is large enough to
accommodate a small table and a handful of people who
might want to dine under the stars. Marcel can often be
found up here looking after the lamp. In addition to signaling passing ships, the light from the Beacon can be used to
alert Sky Kite if any of the lodge’s residents spot fishfolk
raiders heading toward the town.
Crumbling Structures. Just outside the lighthouse are a
handful of partially built stone buildings that were meant to
serve as guesthouse and a mess hall for visitors. However,
the efforts were abandoned, and the structures have since
been taken over by colorful crabs. Every once in a while, a
pair of bulbous spirits appear in the open interior of what
was going to be a bathhouse. Here, they wrestle for days,
growing in size until they pop.
Pixie Boat. Halfway between the lodge and Sky Kite, there’s
a charming houseboat that’s run aground on a sandbar. At
first glance, the boat appears abandoned. However, any careful observer will notice that it is swarming with pixies. The
boat has the name Spellbound painted on its stern, and the
pixies who live here have adopted it as the name of their
community. Several dozen pixies live here, and they don’t
take kindly to uninvited guests. There’s a sailor in Sky Kite
who claims he was heckled and tormented by pixies when
he was adrift at sea after his boat capsized. There’s a good
chance those pixies hailed from the Spellbound.
Sunken Village. This location is described in one of the
adventures included in this book (see page 351).

Adventure Hooks
Supply Run in Sky Kite. Sky Kite Valley has been overrun
with teams of aeronauts who are snatching up the materials
Holly Clintock relies on for her work. Holly has been trying
to track down basic supplies for her work, but it’s all spoken
for by the newcomers. She’s getting desperate and is willing
to give the adventurers her experimental diving trinkets in
exchange for what they can scrounge.
Mission to Toggle. Holly needs a sheet of a specialized
alloy to fix the submersible. This rare metal can only be
forged by Duro and Garo in the town of Toggle. She asks the
adventurers to retrieve the metal from the masters.
Fish Folk Exiles. The lodge, like most places located on the
coast, is subject to the occasional fishfolk raid. However,
lately, a small but bold band of fishfolk have been exceptionally aggressive, even going so far as to sneak into the
lodge and ransack Holly’s workshop. These fishfolk are
a desperate lot, as they were exiled by the Lionfish King
and are now willing to try anything to get back into their
monarch’s good graces. They make their lair in a submerged
village that stands on the sea floor several miles off the
coast north of the lodge. This same group of fishfolk are the
main antagonist in the Below the Shallows adventure (see
page 351)
Crab Invasion! During a storm at night, crabs begin
gathering on the small spit of land the lodge stands upon,
swarming into the crumbling outbuildings and up the
exterior of the lighthouse. By morning, the entire lodge
is encrusted in crabs, and the clacking of their claws is
deafening. And they keep coming ashore! Perhaps they’re
drawn to the lighthouse’s lamp. Or maybe one of the crabs
carries a magical object in its claw that compels the others
to follow. Whatever the reason, Holly and Marcel plead
with the adventurers for help.

HOGSTONE HOT SPRINGS

O

ut of a spring high up the side of Mount Arbora, geothermally heated water comes boiling and bubbling out of a crack
in the stone and flows down the mountainside, getting cooler as it finds its way to the River Yon far below. Legend
has it that the great river spirit known as Yon would sometimes take on the form of a giant boar and bathe in the hot
spring, scratching his bristles on the large stones.

Because of this legend, the ancient druids called this place Hogstone and marked the spring as a place of physical and spiritual healing. In today’s age, a spa has been built for travelers to utilize when journeying to the spring. Large pools have been
carved at different elevations where the water issuing from the hot spring would collect. The hottest pools are higher up the
mountain, closer to the source of the hot spring, and the cooler pools were carved out further down the mountain. Because
of this, Hogstone has a main building with a series of wooden huts and bungalows that are dotted alongside the flow of the
hot springs, connected by smooth stone paths and slate stairs. Some pools are wide and open, allowing for large gatherings
of bathers, while others are smaller and more private, accommodating only a handful of people. Bards entertain with gentle
music while Hogstone’s vigilant staff makes sure that everyone has what they need.
The hot springs are open day and night for all travelers. At night, they are especially delightful as the warm glow of ten
thousand candles illuminates the pools and walkway.

Reputation
Most everyone on Obojima has heard of Hogstone and
many have made long journeys across the land and up the
side of Mount Arbora to get healed by its famously powerful waters. For those who have made the trip, there is
always a story of the powers of Hogstone and on occasion, a
magical vision from the river spirit, Yon.

55

NPCs
Adira, Master Healer (female human). Adira is a master
herbalist and healer who specializes in all manner of plant
medicines and runs the apothecary. She is a short, gentle
woman with a calm yet intense presence. (Adira uses
the Priest* stat block, but rolls all Medicine checks
with advantage)
Mocha (spirit). Mocha is Adira’s companion spirit who
helps Adira with her patients and enjoys being in the guise
of a small pig. Usually, Mocha is happy to just be a pig
and provide a cuddly creature for patients to pet during
their time at the Apothecary. If Adira is ever in need of an
assistant with thumbs, Mocha can begrudgingly take on the
form of a large, anthropomorphic pig person.
Jollah Everbreeze (male human). Jollah is a human bard
who specializes in what he calls the “numinous groove”,
a style of music he learned from spending time in the
Spirit Realm jamming with the spirits. He plays a unique
wind instrument that has a companion spirit living inside
it, allowing Jollah to get a range of smooth, melodic, and
percussive sounds not possible with normal wind instruments. Jollah’s sole purpose is to “get everyone into the
groove” and he is overjoyed when he feels someone has
attained the numinous quality needed to “get there”.

Many members of the Courier Brigade can be
found here soaking off the weariness of riding
many miles delivering goods. If their path
takes them close to Hogstone, they are sure to
stop by and get recharged by the hot spring’s
enchanting waters as the extra trip is always
worth it.

Points of Interest
The Druids Bath. Within the array of soaking pools are
three specialty pools, carved into the mountainside by
the druids that discovered the hot spring. Over time, the
water in these pools became saturated with magics left by
the druids, enhancing the already potent curative properties of the water. These pools are kept apart from the main
hot springs area and are reserved for special healing cases
referred by Hogstone’s resident healer, Adira. Marked by
sturdy wooden fences with simple, elegant gates that are
left unlocked. Anyone can use them at any time, but signs
clearly say they are for healing only.
The pools are as follows:
◊ The Emerald Pool: This pool is made of a solid block of
malachite and its magic waters are capable of mending
wounds and curing ailments. Every 10 minutes a creature spends soaking here heals them 1 hit point. If an
adventurer spends more than 30 minutes in the pool, its
magic ends any disease that is afflicting them and cures
any poison.

56

◊ The Amber Pool: This pool is carved out of a giant drop
of amber and its magic waters can bring vitality back into
the weariest of bones. Anyone staying in the pool for 30
minutes or more can remove all levels of exhaustion and
its magic ends the paralyzed and petrified conditions.
◊ The Azure Pool: This pool is made from a vein of azurite
that has been smoothed over the centuries and its waters
calm the mind and soothe the spirit. Those who bathe in
it for 30 minutes or more find themselves overcome with
a sense of peace and serenity, recovering all spent spell
slots of 3rd level or lower.
Adira’s Apothecary. Along with Hogstone’s many buildings including changing rooms, meeting spaces, and relaxing areas is Adira’s Apothecary, a well-lit place filled with
jars of herbs and pots growing various medicinal plants.
On entering the apothecary, clients are met by Adira,
Hogstone’s resident master of the healing arts. Usually, all
it takes is a look from Adira’s magical staff to know what
ails a person—often it is just a nice soak in one of the
specialty pools or a rub down with her proprietary blend
of magic oils and therapeutic herbs—but sometimes even
her staff’s arcane eye needs a closer look. If this is the case,
she will take patients into an examination room where she
performs her evaluation and diagnosis using a combination
of mundane and magical means, addressing any and all
complaints from chronic ailments and nervous conditions
to witch’s curses and supernatural wounds.

Adventure Hooks
The Mysterious Ailment. Once Adira realizes that the
party is a band of capable adventurers, she approaches one
of them and asks for their help. If the adventurer accepts,
Adira ushers the party into a back room where a man,
covered in glowing red sores, lies on a bed.
If 10 points of healing are given to the man, he becomes
conscious and, if asked, tells a story of an entire village
on the eastern side of the island being taken over by
the Corruption.
Adira says that she has heard rumors of this Corruption, but has never seen it until now. Her remedies are not
producing any favorable results. She asks if the adventurers can help uncover the mystery of this Corruption and, if
possible, help her find a cure.
Return of Yon. Lately, some strange occurrences have been
happening at night. The water in certain pools becomes
unbearably hot, and bathers report seeing a glowing, spectral boar wandering the mountainside. Some claim it’s
the return of Yon, the great river spirit, but opinions vary.
Some think that Yon is disturbed by the intrusion of the
bathers at Hogstone. Others believe a more sinister force is
imitating the spirit. The druids of old left a series of ancient
totems around Hogstone, said to keep the spirit at peace.
Recently, some of these totems have gone missing or been
defaced. Is Yon’s spirit truly angry, or is someone—or something—manipulating the legend for their own ends?

SKY KITE VALLEY

I

n a valley that slopes toward the coast, geothermal activity is on frequent display, sending spouts of warm air high into the
sky. Most days, dozens of colorful gliders and kites can be seen chasing the updrafts and wheeling about in acrobatic displays
above the seaside town called Sky Kite. In terms of size, Sky Kite is second only to Yatamon on the south end of the island.

The town got its name from its tradition of making extravagant kites and gliders, which, according to local beliefs, were
inspired by the airborne jellyfish that float down from Mount Arbora. Kite festivals and competitions are frequent and
considered serious business, and people come from all around to enjoy the colorful spectacle. Visitors to Sky Kite Valley often
remark on the fearless, reckless spirit possessed of the locals who seem concerned only with the sky.
The town is perched on a rocky rise that was quarried long ago, which created the distinct levels that give Sky Kite the
appearance of being built on an enormous stair that descends into the sea. Locally, the town is divided into two halves.
There’s the Saltward by the waterfront, and it’s where fisherfolk, shipwrights, and merchants tend to live. As you ascend the
stepped slope of the town, you eventually cross into the Skyward, where the most renowned kite families live. The boundary
between Saltward and Skyward is colloquially known as “the water line”, which is also the name of a popular, centrally located
pub where folk gather from late afternoon until the early morning hours.

Sky Kite Valley is primarily known for its kites, gliders, and
experimental flying machines. The people here are generally
content to attend to their own affairs and see to their own
projects. This might be due to the town’s relative isolation,
but whatever the reason, Sky Kite Valley remains fairly
disconnected from the happenings of the rest of the island.

Calling All Aeronauts
Sky Kite Valley has always attracted aeronauts looking to
ride their gliders on the region’s thermal vents. Of late,
however, the town is experiencing a boom over the allure
of flight. Tinkerers and aspiring aeronauts have turned Sky
Kite Valley into a hub, with new workshops seeming to
appear overnight. Rooftops have become makeshift launch
sites, and the taverns are abuzz with talk of design ideas
and recountings of failed attempts.

Kite Families
Many locals come from long lines of kite-making families
who have adopted a specific spirit or animal design that
they puts on all their kites. Often, these storied families
have their doors emblazoned with their respective symbols,
treating them like family crests. While some families
embrace the new fascination with flight that has overtaken
the town, most old-timers bristle at the development.

Sky Kite Valley Today
Some months ago, renowned adventurer and aeronaut Rock
Raley arrived in Sky Kite in dramatic fashion—on a glider in
tatters that he somehow managed to pilot all the way from
the peak of Mount Arbora. To the gathered crowd he said,
“It has been many days since my feet felt the ground. I have
climbed higher into the sky than even I thought possible. I
met the Sky King, who personally welcomed us to his kingdom. We need only make it there ourselves!” Overnight,
Sky Kite Valley exploded with activity, as dozens of teams
of engineers and aeronauts strived to ascend to the frontier
among the clouds.

In Sky Kite Valley, adventurers can find gliders
and spend time soaring about on thermal vents.
They could get involved in the expedition to
the clouds, or simply enjoy one of Obojima’s
larger settlements.

GLIDER

Workshops have sprung up all across town, each one
filled with teams of tinkerers and aeronauts all trying to
be the one to build a flying machine capable of ascending
to the Sky King’s domain high above the clouds. Naturally,
rivalries have sprung up among them, and many teams keep
watch to keep spies and saboteurs out.

Culture in Flux
Rock Raley’s feat transformed him into an overnight
celebrity, a status which thrust him into the limelight of
local politics. For generations, the people of Sky Kite were
content with their traditional kite and glider craft. But now,
with the prodding of Rock Raley and his followers, much
of the town has embraced this new pursuit of innovation.
Many town elders are dismayed by this development, as
they regard the “newfangled” contraptions as an unwelcome
blight upon the beauty of the kites and gliders that fill the
sky with graceful beauty. This simmering conflict often
plays out in the town council.

The Sky Team
Rock Raley and his team of aeronauts are spearheading the
effort to build the first vessel that can fly high enough to
reach the Sky King. They have fostered a (mostly) friendly
competition among the engineering teams, though they are
not above stealing the best ideas for themselves.

Reaching for the Sky
Gliders and kites are the primary crafts made in Sky Kite
Valley. Gliders are generally larger and carry pilots, while
kites are built for maneuverability and are controlled from
the ground with lines. Both harness the wind and updrafts
to stay aloft. There are several craftspeople in the town and
surrounding countryside who sell and repair gliders and
kites. Those constructed for competitions typically fetch a
higher price.
Traditional windborne crafts don’t cut it when it comes
to the higher altitude flying that has captured the imaginations of many of Sky Kite’s aeronauts of late. For that, new
workshops have sprung up all over town, each one busy
with teams of hopefuls all trying to be the one to figure
out how to soar into the clouds. Some try the pink candles
associated with the Courier Brigade’s hot air balloons, while
others hope to achieve success with flapping wings, twirling
propellers, or some combination of various approaches.

Airborne Dangers
Near the town, danger from the sky is relatively rare,
though it is not unheard of for malicious spirits or even
daring air pirates to descend on vulnerable aeronauts and
sightseers. Unpredictable winds and sudden storms pose
additional risks. The region’s wild creatures remain the
most common danger, however. Among these are the vast

59

groups of giant floating jellyfish that stream down from
Mount Arbora from time to time. Avoiding them is easy, as
their arrival is easily anticipated. However, their venomous
tentacles make them quite dangerous for anyone caught
among them. There are also hammer gulls that circle
high overhead, ready to plunk someone with the stones
they often carry in their talons. Another nuisance are vent
vaulters, an ambush predator that rides thermal vents to pull
birds out of the air. They usually avoid people, but can cause
serious damage to gliders.

Threats from the Sea
Fish folk from the Shallows remain a constant threat to the
inhabitants of Sky Kite’s saltward. The town maintains a
garrison near the waterfront and a handful of boats that can
be deployed to drive off any raiders.

Unknown to the townsfolk, the master kite maker was once
Rock Raley’s adventuring partner, but Rock had abandoned
Louise in the Crawling Canopy years ago. As long as Rock
has the hearts of the townsfolk, Louise wants nothing to do
with them.
Holly Clintock (female human). Holly spends most of
her time in the Coastal Divers’ Lodge near Sky Kite, but
she comes to town from time to time to scoop up supplies
and perhaps grab a meal and a drink at the Waterline Pub.
With all the would-be aeronauts in town, supplies are hard
to come by these days, and Holly is becoming increasingly
frustrated with the newcomers. Anyone who can help her
secure what she needs could quickly become a friend. For
more on Holly, see the Coastal Divers’ Lodge on page 24.

NPCs
Rockwell “Rock” Raley (male human). Rock is the
consummate aeronaut, with his head forever in the clouds.
He has a seemingly bottomless supply of energy and can’t
sit still. His excitement is infectious, and he is always sharing stories of past expeditions or talking about the next one.
He has an easy charm, a warm smile, and is quick to address
strangers as “friend.”
Beneath his friendly demeanor is a simmering ambition. Rock is more than willing to use others and exploit
his own celebrity to further his own goals, which is to get
the precious ambergris rumored to remain within the Sky
King’s enormous skull.
Councilor Jiko (female human). Jiko is the oldest of the
five leaders that make up the town council. She’s hotheaded
and brash, and she often excuses her own words with, “I
call it as I see it.” She is the most outspoken against what
she calls “the reckless aeronauts who want to clog the skies
with their noisy contraptions.” She’s at her wit’s end with
the business, and has begun entertaining means beyond the
council to deter or drive off the nuisance.
Olaya (spirit). This small serpentine spirit is drawn to
creativity and the thrill of a breakthrough. It is easily bored
and tends to latch onto folks who demonstrate ingenuity.
Olaya is normally a transparent spirit, but it becomes more
opaque as it feeds off creative energy. As Sky Kite Valley
buzzes with activity surrounding the expedition to the Sky
King, Olaya can often be found lurking in workshops. By
some, it is regarded as a kind of muse, as it has a knack
for asking the right questions. Others see the spirit as an
ever-present nuisance who is all but impossible to get rid of.
Louise, Master Kite Maker (female human). Louise’s
expertise in kite crafting is unrivaled in all of Sky Kite.
However, she hasn’t come out with a new creation in quite
some time. Some speculate that Louise has retired, while
others whisper that she has lost her touch.

ROCKWELL
“ROCK” RALEY

Marlon, Warden of Barges (male Nakudama). Marlon
oversees Sky Kite’s locks, and it falls to him to huff and
puff his way up and down the stair that runs parallel to the
lock as barges pass through it. However, he is also exceedingly lazy and perpetually aggrieved by the prospect of
doing any amount of work. He grumbles nonstop about his
lot in life, and bemoans anything that complicates matters
on the locks.
Rufus and Mal, Caretakers of the Waterline Pub (male
and female human). The brother and sister duo who
currently operate the storied pub have run into a streak
of good fortune with the recent boom in the city. They
had run the pub into the ground in little less than a year
and had been only days away from notifying the pub’s
owner that the Waterline would have to close its doors. But
that’s when Rock Raley showed up and instantly made
the Waterline the place to be once again. The siblings
now intend to ride out the success for as long as possible.
Rufus is one of Rock’s most sycophantic allies, and Mal has
even gone so far as to spread rumors that Councilor Jiko is a
corrupt official.
MARLON, WARDEN
OF BARGES

The couriers have a base in the Saltward,
where they maintain a small fleet of boats.
They also run a small shop that outfits repair
kits for both the ships’ canvas sails and the
lantern currently kept in Yatamon.

Sky Kite Valley is the closest settlement to
the northern lodge of the Mariners’ Guild, so
it’s somewhat common for members of the
Mariners’ Guild to pass through the city on
their way there.

Even the local chapter of the Young Stewards
is being swept up in the race to the clouds. Kite
building has been a central feature of the local
stewards, but now it has taken on a competitive dimension, complete with kite races.

The Patchwork Robe Coven, which makes its
headquarters in Sky Kite Valley, now also has a
storefront in the Skyward, which is almost exclusively dedicated to the mending of gliders.
Behind the counter of their shop, a dozen or so
witches, each with dozens of sewing needles
hovering about them, furiously work to keep
up with the demand for repairs.

Points of Interest
The Waterline Pub. The drinks are adequate and the food
leaves much to be desired, but the old pub is a favorite gathering place for anyone interested in the art of gliding, or—
in recent days—flight. Patrons tend to file into the Waterline to grab a drink and witness the day’s test flights. The
balconies that surround each of the pub’s four stories offer
an unobstructed view of the dozen or so flight attempts that
occur each day from the rooftop launch site—a thermal vent
beneath the pub that has been harnessed and funneled to
the roof.
Rock’s Workshop. The center of the Skyward boasts an
enormous hangar that Rock Raley and his crew have taken
to be their workshop. The team has been hard at work
planning and fabricating the vessel in which they intend
to ascend to the Sky King. During the day, crowds gather
at the entrance, hoping to catch a glimpse of the adventurer himself. Those who bear an invitation from Rock are
welcome to enter the workshop and hang out, giving the
place the air of an exclusive club. Others watch inward
from an exterior rope that keeps the crowd at bay near the
entrance of the hangar.

61

Ember’s Kite Shop and Rentals. There’s no shortage of
kite and glider shops in town. Some boast of selling the
highest quality products, while others claim the honor
of being the oldest. Only Ember claims to be the town’s
friendliest kitemonger. Her shop is located in a charming warehouse building on the lock in the Skyward. Ember
wants her customers to feel taken care of, especially the ones
who don’t know their way around a kite or glider. That’s why
she’s the only shop who offers rentals. She’s even willing to
close the shop if business is slow to teach novices.
The Locks. Sky Kite is trisected into the south, central,
and north city sections by the multi-stepped locks that
allow boats to bring cargo from the sea all the way up to the
highest reaches of the Skyward. The stair that runs parallel
to the locks from top to bottom is a popular tourist attraction for those who like to watch the boats come and go. The
warden of barges oversees the locks from the squat, round
tollhouse on the waterfront at the gate of the lowest lock.
Occasionally, fishfolk sneak into the locks and conduct raids
in the town’s interior.

Adventure Hooks
Glider Race. A glider race is set to take place as the
capstone event of a kite festival. It’s a team event, where
participants use the updrafts provided by thermal vents to
speed across the Land of Hot Water. Each participant has
their own glider. To win, an entire team must cross the
finish line before other teams do so. The size of the teams
should match the number of players. This race has its
complications, however. Strong wind could push racers out
to sea or up against the slope of Mount Arbora. A bunch of
hammer gulls might show up and begin dropping stones on
the gliders from high in the air, forcing several gliders to
crash land. Whatever happens, the adventurers and another
team find themselves stranded together.
Sabotage. Councilor Jiko has taken matters into her own
hands to thwart the upstart aeronauts who she believes
have taken over her town. Her assistant has reached out to
find willing saboteurs to pay a visit to Rock Raley’s workshop and make their contraptions disappear. This adventure
could go in one of two ways:
◊ The adventurers are enlisted as the saboteurs and must
figure out how to sneak into Rock Raley’s busy workshop
and complete the mission.
◊ Air pirates successfully made off with some crucial plan,
and the adventurers are recruited by Rock Raley or a
group of aeronauts to recover what was stolen. The pirates
have a stronghold on the western slope of Mount Arbora.

62

Refugees from Polewater. Two fisherfolk—Gav and
Anders (male humans)—have been hanging around the
Saltward and in the Waterline Pub where they pester
strangers for news out of the village of Polewater on the
east side of the island. They are refugees from that village
and have been unable to return since the tsunami hit the
island several months ago. They’ve attempted the voyage
several times on their own boats, but have been forced to
return because of attacks from particularly aggressive fishfolk. They are desperate to get home, or at least for any hint
of news. When the pair sees the adventurers, they approach
with hopeful eyes. For more on the events in Polewater, see
page 85.
Names in the Lock. After a night of restless sleep, the
adventurers are approached by a courier who gives them a
summons from the warden of barges to come to the locks.
Waiting at the locks is Marlon, the warden, who hands
them a small cylindrical case. He explains that it was found
today in the topmost segment of the lock, which had been
drained to address a malfunction. Inside the case is a spindle
of ivory, and on the spindle are written the names of each
adventurer along with the name Ferris Skyright and Marlon
himself. Marlon demands to know the meaning of this, and
enlists the adventurers to find the connection. He would do
it himself if he wasn’t so busy. The restless sleep continues
until the adventurers determine what’s happening.
Below the Shallows. This is one of the adventures
included in this book (see page 351).

MOUNT ARBORA
Towering majestically over Obojima, Mount Arbora stands as the island’s most sacred peak and as its mystic sentinel. Its
snowcapped summit is visible from every corner of the island, an ever-present reminder of its ancient power. From these icy
heights, meltwater cascades down in shimmering rivulets, weaving through the island’s lush forests and fertile plains. Each of
these rivers is inhabited by an elder spirit from whom the rivers each get their names. These rivers nourish the land, earning
Mount Arbora the reverent title of “Obojima’s beating heart”.
But the mountain is more than a life source; it is a realm of awe and peril. Its rugged slopes are shrouded in mystery,
cloaked in thick mists and treacherous crags. Legends speak of the mystical energies that course through its mineral-rich
veins, infusing the mountain with a potent magic that both attracts and repels.
Beneath its serene exterior, Mount Arbora harbors untold dangers; massive creatures, believed to be remnants of a
primordial era, roam its slopes. These titanic beings, both feared and revered, add to the mountain’s enigmatic allure. Few
dare to venture into their dominion, but those who do seek the mountain’s deep secrets and the power said to lie within its
hallowed peaks.

Wandering Encounters
Roll
d12

Wandering Encounter

1

Gentle Guide. Depending on your location on the mountain (above or below the tree line), you encounter either a dryad*
or a peaceful spirit that looks like a boulder. They offer cryptic guidance or a minor boon if treated respectfully.

2

Pesky Spirits. A band of mischievous fire spirits attempt to play tricks on the party. They may burn items, lead the party
astray, or cause minor illusions.

3

Avalanche! On a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) saving throw, the party hears the sounds of rocks and/or snow beginning to rumble, signifying an impending avalanche. A series of skill checks must be made to avoid imminent disaster!

4

Ancient Guardian. An awakened tree or spirit boulder blocks the path and demands to know who is treading on the
sacred slopes of Mount Arbora. Some Charisma checks and roleplaying are in order to go beyond the stubborn yet
wise guardian.

5

Runic Stone. The party stumbles upon a glowing runic stone. Whoever touches or interacts with the stone gets put into
an altered state where they come face to face with an elder spirit that may or may not be the spirit of Mount Arbora. After
some roleplaying and skill checks, they may be granted a temporary magical boon.

6

Snowstorm. A sudden, magical snowstorm engulfs the party. Visibility drops and navigation becomes challenging.
Monsters adapted to the cold might take advantage of the party’s disorientation.

7

Treasure Hunter. An eccentric treasure hunter from Toggle offers to trade information about hidden treasures on the
mountain in exchange for assistance with a dangerous task. The prospector could be an ally or a secret foe who wishes to
lead the party into peril.

8

Frozen Clue. What looks like a person can be seen, frozen in the glacial ice. The frozen adventurer may hold a vital clue,
magical item, or be revived through powerful magic to share tales of their journey.

9

Snowball Fight! A group of snowball spirits greet the party. Will it be a friendly encounter or a snowball fight?

10

Find My Percy! A distraught and exhausted farmer pleads with the party to find their pet snowshoe pig, Percival. Some
clever tracking can lead the party to Percival, but it also may lead them to a monster tracking the pig as well!

11

Hunters are the Hunted. The party begins to be tracked by a hill dragon that has taken to the mountain slopes in search
of prey.

12

Blood of the Mountain. In a small cave on the mountainside is a clear pool of water. Drinking from it could heal, provide
visions, or mark someone for one of the great beasts such as the Sky Salamander or the Hunter.

T

THE GRAYSTEPS

his small settlement on the southern slope of Mount Arbora is unique in that spirits don’t go near it. Whether they
refuse to or simply can’t remains a subject of debate, though the most widely accepted theory credits the weather worn
stone statues that ring the village. Whatever the reason, it must also be noted that the Graysteps has no parallel in the
Spirit Realm.
The village is populated by folk who want to, as the locals say, “live in quiet”. To travelers passing through the village, it can
come across as cold, its residents a bit standoffish. The truth of it is that a palpable suspicion for all things relating to spirits
hangs heavy in the air. Spirit mediums and clairvoyants live here to calm the constant noise from the spirit world. People
visit the Graysteps either as refuge against malevolent spirits, or to find specialists and items to help them deal with spirits.
Getting to the Graysteps isn’t always an easy journey. Where Mount Arbora rises up from the Gale Fields, there is a narrow
path—a winding stair—cut directly into the mountainside. Those who manage the ascent eventually come to a tunnel that
opens onto a sheltered vale where the Graysteps stands. Snow blankets the village for much of the year, but travelers who
arrive when the snow has melted will see the green and black tiled rooftops arrayed in the pattern of an eye.

Tone/Vibe
Remote, cold and wintery, close-knit,

Reputation
Many Obojimans aren’t aware of the Graysteps, but those
who do typically regard it as an out-of-way village filled
with ornery folk. Spirits know enough to stay away
from there.

65

Mausoleum Statues
The oldest structures in the Graysteps are the five thirtyfoot-tall statues that surround the village like great standing stones. They are known as the Statues of Warding and
Welcome, or simply “the statues”. They resemble people,
but with two fronts: one that faces outward depicted with
a shield, and another that faces in toward the village, with
arms outstretched in a gesture of comfort. In addition to the
theory that they are the reason that spirits don’t come to the
Graysteps, they serve as mausoleums for the village’s dead.

The Watchers
Protection of the Graysteps falls to a small guard force
called the Watchers. Though their main purpose is keeping spirits away, they mostly spend their time driving off
monsters that wander down from the mountain. There are
six watchers, five to parallel the five statues that surround
the village, and one captain.

Unlikely Defense
When a villager dies, their body is encased in red clay and
placed inside one of the mausoleum statues. This tradition
has been kept by the people of the Graysteps for centuries and is rooted in mutual agreement made by those
who have chosen to live here. In times of
need, the village can call upon the dead
housed within a Statue of Warding and
Welcome to awaken as a kind of golem
to aid the village.
Though the people here keep this
tradition, it is not a practice they
reveal to outsiders. They believe
that, if revealed to the rest
of the island, they would be
condemned and undone.

new to his position as elder, and his tenure is defined by
his campaign to safeguard the Graysteps from what he calls
“encroachments” from the Spirit Realm. The Corruption is
just the latest example of “spirit shenanigans,” according to
Phent’s most recent refrain.
His contempt for spirits is deeper than the villagers know.
The cellar in his home has a secret chamber where he
keeps a bound spirit captive. The spirit was tainted by the
Corruption, and with prodding from Phent, has lost itself
to madness. Once its fully gone through its transformation
to demon, Phent plans to set the spirit loose in the town
of Toggle in order to foment more fear and paranoia about
spirits amongst the people.
Stout Crumm (male elf). Short, stocky, and silent, Stout
Crumm is a fixture in Murgin’s Tavern. It’s rumored that
she was one of the Rangers of the Greenward Path who were
among the first to encounter the Corruption. But you won’t
readily hear it from her because she doesn’t say anything
beyond the occasional grunt or snort. Most of the time, she
communicates by scrawling on a slate with a piece of chalk.
Only folks
who buy her a drink can inquire about her experience with
the Corruption.
Before she was marked by the Corruption, Crumm was
known as an accomplished warrior, and she is a champion
that can be challenged to earn a sword school signet.
Grimcloak (female human). The wizard known as Grimcloak runs a small arcana and curio shop in the cellar of
Murgin’s Tavern and Inn. He has only been in the Graysteps
for a few months, but he has established a reputation for
his ability to reverse curses and hexes, particularly those
associated with spirits. He has a short, wild black beard and
a faded blue patch over one eye. Even indoors, he wears his
hooded brown cloak. He speaks in hushed tones and his
sentences tend to trail off.

RED BURIAL CLAY

Points of Interest
The Way Gate. Approaching the village from the mountain stair, travelers must first pass through the Way Gate, a
tunnel that cuts straight through the rock face. The tunnel
was bored by Nakudama in the time of the monarchs.
Though its purpose has been lost to history, it remains
a testament to the stonecarving prowess of that civilization, for within it, the walls and ceiling are all covered
in a continuous bas-relief rendition of a royal procession
through curling clouds.
GRIMCLOAK

The tunnel is approximately 120 feet long, and large
enough for a cart pulled by two horses to pass through. The
Watchers patrol the tunnel, but even so, monsters often
nest here when the snow is deep outside.
Murgin’s Tavern and Inn. The only tavern in the village
is crowded most nights with locals. The occasional travelers that visit invariably end up here, and not only because
it serves as the inn, but also because Murgin’s is famous
for its perfect baguettes. The tavern keeper, affectionately
called “the King ‘’ by locals, makes the baguettes himself
each night, and he likes seeing the delight on peoples faces
as they enjoy the meal he’s prepared.
The tavern’s main room has three hearths around which
rustic wooden chairs are arranged. The place is often
smokey and the air thick with the smell of earthy spices. A
two-story wing branches off from the main room containing six rooms for guests.

Adventure Hooks
He also carries a secret. Grimcloak is a disguise—a
complete fabrication. If the old wizard were to remove
his robe, he would revert to Nuharo, a fourteen year old
human girl who apprentices with the Cloud Cap Coven.
Her entrepreneurial spirit led her to set up shop in the
Graysteps, and, so far, no one knows her true identity. The
only thing she and Grimcloak share aside from magical
talent is the eyepatch. Grimcloak/Nuharo uses the witch
stat block.
Patcher. The current captain of the Watchers is a boisterous
teller of tall tales known by the villagers only as Patcher.
When he’s not making his rounds patrolling the perimeter of the village with the other Watchers, he can usually
be found in his modest watchtower dwelling at the north
end of the Graysteps. As captain of the Watchers, Patcher
possesses the Rod of Awakening, a magical length of iron
that gives him the ability to animate the dead within the
village’s mausoleum statues.

Crash Across The Mountain. An avalanche from high
on the slopes of Mount Arbora overcame two of the village
Watchers while traversing the mountainside. Patcher
can’t abandon his post, so he has asked the adventurers
to travel alongside the remaining Watchers and conduct a
recovery mission.
Sheep in Wolf’s Clothing. A spirit known as the Horned
Wolf was spotted at the edges of the town on the same day
that a villager has gone missing. Phent blames the spirit and
asks the adventurers to drive it off or kill it. However, when
the adventurers meet the spirit, they’re quick to discover
that its cub is also missing.

Fiendish Origins. Though few villagers want to talk about it,
AHA academics have suggested that the mausoleum statues
are a vestige of the demon tyrant from the Age of Nakudama.

JUMAGA’S ROOST

igh on the western slope of Mount Arbora is the lair of the Sky Salamander, one of the great beasts that circle the skies
of Obojima. The Sky Salamander patrols its mountain territory and casts a shadow on any farmer who takes the risk to
graze their cattle on the wide, verdant slopes of the great mountain. Although the slopes are the salamander’s domain,
it’s a risk many are willing to take, as the grasses are said to contain the mountain’s magic, making any cow, sheep, or goat that
grazes there fat and happy.

The Ledge of Offering
Near one of Mount Arbora’s low mountain peaks, where
the sky salamander makes its lair is an outcropping of rock
known as the Ledge of Offerings. Throughout the centuries, people have come here to leave offerings to the sky
salamander for varying reasons. Many farmers make the
pilgrimage up the steep trail in hopes of appeasing the giant
beast or to ward off its hungry eyes from their cattle. But
there is no evidence that the salamander takes their tokens
into account as it still seems to enjoy nothing more than
devouring a plump and ponderously slow cow.
Others make the journey to the ledge, for less practical
reasons, making the trek to the Ledge of Offerings to ask for

68

the salamander’s strength, believing wholeheartedly that
simply being in the presence of the great beast will imbue
power and wisdom.
But most who have witnessed or heard stories of the
salamander’s devastating power believe that braving such a
journey only gets one perilously close to the salamander’s
bone-crushing jaws.

The Sky Salamander is fairly well-known throughout
Obojima and most islanders have heard of it.

Jeelah (female human). Jeelah is a Rockwinder and one of
the best guides in Dorrin and recently has gained a heroic
status as the only Rockwinder to have gotten close enough
to Jumaga to actually touch it. Though she is grateful for
the experience and is enjoying the attention, she also sees
the Sky Salamander as immensely sacred and wishes to be
respectful of the great beast. Because of this, she rarely talks
about her experience.

Anyone who lives near the Sky Salamander, especially
the Rockwinders (see below), knows that it has good days
and bad days. On its good days, it is a splendid sight soaring through the clear mountain air—a true symbol ofMount
Arbora’s awe and majesty. On the days when it is grumpy,
the Sky Salamander can be an indiscriminate and savage
predator that goes out of its way to take the largest and most
succulent of all the herds that graze in Arbora’s foothills.

Rockwinders
There is a small village on the western side of Mount
Arbora called Dorrin, where a group of people known as
Rockwinders have lived for generations. These sure-footed
people have traditionally been hired as guides for those
wishing to traverse the mountain or for those who wish to
make the dangerous journey to the Ledge of Offering and
pay homage to the Sky Salamander, who the Rockwinders
call Jumaga. The Rockwinders also act as guardians of the
Ledge—keeping curious fools and reckless thrillseekers
from getting themselves killed, as well as keeping desperate thieves from looting the mounds of treasure that lie
exposed on the grassy cliff face.

Karmajin (male human). Karmajin is the least scrupulous
of the Rockwinders, being one of the few who have traveled outside of the village. Though Karmajin was born in
Dorrin, he spent his early years traveling the Gale Fields in a
merchant’s caravan. When he returned to the village several
years later, he was met with open arms but has since left a
bad impression on those who took him in.
He’s now gained a less trustworthy reputation, as the
Rockwinder most willing to lead an expedition of thieves to
the Ledge of Offerings.
Though Karmajin’s tolerance for rapscallions and ne’erdo-wells is much higher than the average Rockwinder, he is
very superstitious, so he won’t do any looting for himself.
He would, however, be more than happy to take a cut from
the ill-gotten gains stolen by others.

The Rockwinders also protect Jumaga from people and
protect people from Jumaga. They know the patterns and
warning signs of the Sky Salamander—they can predict its
moods and see to it that travelers don’t unduly put themselves in harm’s way.

The Sky Salamander
The Sky Salamander is one of the great beasts that reside
on the island. The Rockwinders say that of the three—the
Hunter and the Sky King being the other two—Jumaga is
the youngest, so if you were able to speak with a spirit that
is old enough, they may even recall the day Jumaga arrived
on the island.
Though Jumaga isn’t overly aggressive to those living
around the base of the mountain, only swooping down on
the rare occasion to take the errant cow or goat, it is very
territorial. It has kept dominance in its small slice of Mount
Arbora for centuries and has recently gained a reputation
for being the bane of the aeronauts and glider pilots from
Sky Kite Valley.

Ledge of Offering. Those who travel to the Ledge of Offering bring a variety of gifts to be left to the Sky Salamander,
which is why at any given time the plateau is likely to be
filled with valuable items unusable by the creature they’ve
been gifted to. From gold flowers to First Age trinkets, the
ledge sees it all.

Cry From Above. A distant cry for help can be heard overhead as the adventurers witness a member of the Young
Stewards being carried off by the Sky Salamander. As the
great beast swoops down low, the young steward pries free
from its grasp and is dropped and left abandoned somewhere in the wilderness of Mount Arbora.

Roost. Nestled in the tree-covered heights of the mountain which overlook the Ledge of Offering, is a giant woven
nest not too dissimilar to that of a bird. It’s in the location
where the Sky Salamdar rests its heavy head. Scattered
across the lush forest and strewn about the rocky cliff
faces surrounding the sky salamandar’s roost, is the cattle
graveyard that it has crafted over the hundreds of years it
has called this roost its home. Though a fresh cattle carcass
can be concerning, most have been overgrown and covered
by blankets of bright green moss and vibrant flowers which
seem to bloom year-round.

Legendary Loot. While the Ledge of Offering is considered
a sacred site by the locals, there are those less scrupulous
folks who, after a few ales, begin to whisper about some of
the more valuable offerings rumored to have been left up
there on the ledge.

Dorrin. The village of Dorrin has called the western slopes
of Mount Arbora home for centuries. It’s an unlikely
settlement that has uncomfortable living conditions, to say
the least, but the small group of 100-plus islanders that
live there have done so for generations. Until recently, the
village’s main source of trade came when outsiders desired
a guide up the mountain. Now, after the discovery of the
Dorrin Plate and its potion-brewing qualities, the village
has turned its attention to the new commodity as it has
drummed up quite a bit of trade and visitation to the small
mountain town.

Many would-be plunderers are kept away by the tales
of the sky salamander swooping down to pluck a hapless
traveler off the mountainside, and those who don’t fear the
salamander shudder at the thought of being cursed after
stealing sacred offerings. But there are some who are slowly
working up the courage as rumors continue to spread of
treasures being left there that would make the most devout
monk break their vow of poverty.

TOGGLE
THE STEELWORK TOWN

O

n the eastern slope of Mount Arbora sits Toggle, a mining town built into the sides of a man-made canyon, dug out of
the bedrock in the shape of a giant “X” over centuries of mining. The canyon mines have long since run dry and the
empty mine shafts were renovated so they could be occupied by the two hundred or so people who currently call Toggle
their home. Many of these occupants are miners who work all over the mountainside, but some occupants are merchants and
artisans who set up their shops in the town center and serve the passing travelers and traders who come to Toggle.

Tone/Vibe
Close Community, Unique lifestyle, Celebratory,
Holds onto Tradition

The Crossroads
Toggle’s town center, or the “Crossroads in the Canyon”, is
filled with workshops, storefronts, and a bustling market
where all kinds of metal goods, crafts, weapons, armor,
and jewelry are made and sold. Each of the four streets
of Toggle’s famous crossroads has a tavern that serves the
populace day and night.

Togglers
The townfolk of Toggle or “Togglers”, as they are known,
are tough, no nonsense folk who speak directly and seldom
conceal their thoughts when they arise. They have little use
for pomp and festivals and prefer to celebrate in the taverns
after a hard day’s work. One thing they do love is singing,
and it is not uncommon that a spontaneous singing competition breaks out and a crowd gathers to applaud and shout
out their favorite.

71

Of Miners and Mining

NPCs

The miners of Toggle are proud to carry on the tradition of
their forebears even after the ancestral mines ran dry. New
claims are a fairly recent development, and only the Miner’s
Code keeps these independent miners from squabbling for
new mining space. Some say that Toggle is at the end of
the boom, but others say the next boom is just around
the bend.

Duro and Garo (male daras). Duro and Garo are dara
forgemasters who, in the last decade, have made a name for
themselves amongst crafters and creatives across the island.
The pair invented a special forging technique with which
they inscribe glyphs of knowledge into heated metal before
folding and pressing it. In this special technique, known as
“glyph folding”, the duo can create incredibly durable ingots
and objects by layering numerous glyphs while forging.

During the day, Toggle’s hundred or so miners leave for
their claims that are staked on the mountainside. Once
at their mines, the miners wake up their various spirit
companions, many of which sleep within copper lined
cylinders on their belts. Known by the miners as a “light
bunny”, these handy companions are used for igniting their
headlamps and finding veins of ore within the mineshaft.
At dusk, they return to their favorite taverns where drinking and singing go well into the night. Even the most obvious outsider in Toggle will earn a clap on the back from the
most hardened miner if they have a voice of gold. If you can
sing, you can get respect.

Getting Toggled
If someone does something that the community feels
crosses the line or breaks the Miner’s Code, like stealing
another’s spot in the mines, the townsfolk have crafted a
fitting punishment known as “getting Toggled”, which is
short for being hogtied and thrown into a minecart that’s
sent down the side of the mountain, off a ramp, and jettisoned into the woods.

A Special Currency
In Toggle, people prefer to pay in chunks of metal ore in
place of flowers and petals. All merchants are happy to
accept copper buds, sea petals, and dawn flowers, but ingots
are the local currency and another sign of the fierce independent streak in Togglers.

Denizens of the Mines
The mines of Toggle have more than just gems and ore inside
them, they are also the home to many dangerous creatures.
Slaggers are bulbous, stone balloons that float through
the caverns. Each with a menacing face and stony, gray skin
like cooling magma. Because they are territorial and moody,
anyone entering the mine will usually encounter a slagger
and have to pay homage by giving it a shovelful of coal. If a
slagger is not appeased, it can cause collapses or melt the
steel of the mine cart rails, picks, and shovels.
Drumbellys are also a common occurrence within the
mines. Because of a drumbellys attraction to rhythms,
miners have learned to hit their picks and hammers in odd
intervals to prevent attracting one.

72

The two will sporadically sell their glyph-folded metal in
the form of ingots or tools and will rarely take on custom
work. But the pair is always interested in a curious job
and are more inclined to take you up on a query if they find
it amusing.
Johnny One-Eye and Thugg (human male & spirit).
Ever since Johnny One-Eye lost his eye, he’s turned even
meaner and become a bit of a bully. His father, Rhemus
Grood, was one of the most successful miners that Toggle
has ever produced, and Johnny has never lived up to his
father’s legend. But since Johnny has inherited all of his
father’s mines, he does well simply renting them out and
collecting half the haul of ore.
If anyone steps out of line, Johnny’s companion spirit—a
hulking blob of swirling onyx smoke named Thugg—steps
in to make sure there’s compliance.
Isabel Skiff (human female). Isabel is a high-society AHA
member who is looking for a rare gemstone known as a
dragon’s fist, that is, according to her research, said to only
grow in the eastern region around Mount Arbora. The only
dragon’s fist gemstones ever to be unearthed have all been
excavated in and around the mines of Toggle. Isabel is well
funded and has the most up to date gem hunting equipment which also has the effect of making her stick out like
a sore thumb. But despite her city-born manners and dapper
clothes, she is earnest in her desire to roll up her sleeves
with the miners and show any and all that she can dig with
the best of them—and find AHA a dragon’s fist while
she’s at it.
Tetsuri (human male). Tetsuri is a corrupted ranger,
who in the last few weeks has been hiding their identity
as a new face in Toggle. During the initial incursion of the
Corruption, Tetsuri was infected and fled his village to avoid
potentially infecting those he loved. Weakened and desperate, Tetsuri made a deal with Venomous Rex who slowed
Tetsuri’s Corruption using stonefish venom. Now Tetsuri
is hooked and to get more doses of the rare venom, acts as
Venomous Rex’s underling. Currently, the ranger is waiting for Holly to come to Toggle so he can kidnap her and
take her to Venomous Rex’s headquarters. If Tetsuri hears
the party talking about Holly, the Pointue, or tracking down
Duro’s golem, Tetsuri will attempt to befriend and assist the
party, waiting until the time is right to strike.

Points of Interest

DURO
GARO

The Four Paths. The four paths of the crossroads are the
four major streets within Toggle, which meet at the center
of town. Named after the cardinal directions, each path has
its own theme and variety of goods or services that it is
known for.
◊ The Northern Path mostly deals in raw materials—iron,
copper, nickel, and rare metals like gold and zinc ore.
They also sell fabulous raw gemstones that the miners
find while hunting in the caves.
◊ The Southern Path deals in shipping and transporting
all the goods that Toggle produces, and the street is lined
with miners sending or receiving goods from the Courier
Brigade, whose office is here running day and night.

Isabel Skiff is looking for a dragon’s fist gem
and, unless she finds anything else of note,
plans to leave after she’s done it.

Because of trade, the Courier Brigade has a
larger office here where they receive and send
ingots and ore far and wide.

The Young Stewards occasionally stay at an inn
in Toggle as they explore Mount Arbora.

Adventure Hooks
Mission to Toggle, Continued. If the adventurers accepted
Holly’s quest to find the forgemasters of Toggle, they arrive
to find Duro and Guro lacking the metal Holly requested.
The two explain that it is quite difficult to craft a metal of
that quality, and in the weeks leading up to the adventurer’s
arrival, they failed to produce said metal several times. They
do, however, offer a solution.
Long ago, Duro and Garo built a metal golem out of ingots
of glyph-folded steel that had been folded two hundred
times—the most they had ever done. The metal alone was
of an alloy so magical that the golem gained sentience and
wandered off. The golem was last sighted in the Brackwater Wetlands without a spot of rust on its gleaming armor.
If the adventurers could retrieve the golem, its chest plate
could be reforged to fit Holly’s specifications.

◊ The Eastern Path is where the smelters refine the raw
ore and fashion it into ingots. The smelters here are also
known to cast metal objects and sculptures, or make
alloys with refined ores.
◊ The Western Path is where forging and metal fabrication occurs, hence it is aptly named “Clanging Alley” with
all the sounds of the smithies hard at work making their
weapons, armor, tools, and other works of art amid a
merry and constant clang of steel on steel.
The Toggle. The Toggle is a massive metal lever that
controls the flow of a small river that runs parallel to the
town. Switching the Toggle one way directs some of the
water to a power hammer known locally as Iddy Biddy.
Pulling the lever the other way channels the water down a
steep water flume which the Courier Brigade uses to send
packages down the mountainside.
The Iron Ore. The Iron Ore is Toggle’s most popular inn.
Located along the Northern Path, the Iron Ore is a giant,
open floor A-frame feast hall and home to the famed power
hammer Iddy Biddy. The barkeep and proprietor, Moko-Ji, is
a retired Nakudama miner who has turned the Iron Ore into
a kind of museum of mining and minerals. He has hung all
his various pieces of mining gear, including his most epic
finds which are all on display throughout the inn.

Legends
Clove. Every veteran miner has a spine-chilling story about
Clove, a legendary drumbelly that lurks in the miles of
tunnels dug into the side of Mount Arbora. Every miner who
claims to have survived an encounter with Clove (and the
number is few) all say that they smelled something very odd
just before they were attacked—the sweet smell of cloves.

Missing Spirit. A young miner has lost his companion spirit
in one of the copper veins. The light bunny jumped inside
one of the walls to hunt for ore and never returned. He’s
offered all that he has to see his companion returned safely.

THE GALE FIELDS
In the heart of Obojima lies the Gale Fields, a sweeping expanse of towering grasses that sway and undulate in the breeze. In
some places, the grassland seems to breathe with life, and in other areas the grass looks like plants from an ancient seabed
transformed into a fantastical terrain.
Although many of the roads were forged by the Courier Brigade to ensure safer passage for their knights, the oldest of the
roads are thought to be the last remaining remnants of the ancient Nakudama city Lilywin. These roads are maintained and used
by the Courier Brigade to this day, but they are also traveled by the daring or desperate, as these roads offer little protection from
the many dangers that lurk in the grasses—a host of fearsome monsters that make the Gale Fields their hunting ground.
But amid this wild, open space there are communities that thrive. The nomadic Stiltwalkers are among the more intriguing.
Stiltwalkers have adapted to the Gale Fields’ unique challenges, walking high above the grass on stilts as do their tall, mobile
dwellings, striding along on 12-foot tall poles. In this way, a Stiltwalker village can move several miles in a day. Most everyone
who lives in the Gale Fields has learned to exist in harmony with the beasts that inhabit the fields, but there are ancient spirits here too, strange entities that guide or mislead travelers.

Wandering Encounters
Roll

Wandering Encounter

1

Howlers. 2d4 Howlers begin to stalk and encircle the party. You can announce their presence by having the party hear
their howls over the swishing of the wind through the grass or have the encounter be an ambush.

2

Lethal Trickster. During the daytime, a monster that can make a cry like a small child tries to pull do-gooders off the path
and into the tall grass.

3

Stiltwalker Nomads. A group of 1d6+1 Stiltwalker nomads offers trade and tales of the Gale Fields. They have unique
items, are knowledgeable about the safest routes, know hidden paths, have a quest or two, and may offer to have the party
stay a night in one of their stilt houses.

4

Gale Spirit. A spirit emerges from the tall grass. They could offer guidance, reveal a hidden path, ask for help, or lead the
party into deeper danger.

5

Ambush! 1d4+1 bandits (use bandit* stat block) are lying in wait within the tall grass. They attempt to ambush the party
for valuables.

6

The Crawling Canopy. The party encounters the Crawling Canopy. You could have them see it from a distance—oddly out
of place in the Gale Fields. The forest could be moving or stationary for the time being. The forest could also engulf them
as they camp in the Gale Fields (this could start the adventure in this book titled Lost Within the Crawling Canopy).

7

Howls of Pain. A lone, injured howler crosses paths with the party. It’s desperate and dangerous. It might have got separated from its pack or banished or it could all be a clever ploy.

8

Witchcraft at Work. A witch from the Fish Head Coven has found a massive skeleton. They don’t know if it is a dragon or
some ancient megafauna but they are trying to figure out how to unearth it. Once they do, they will try to animate it.

9

Bugung the Smusher. Bugung the Smusher is a spirit with an ego the size of Mount Arbora. Bugung is looking to eat some
gophers, but Bugung is hungry so, at this point, pretty much anything will do.

10

Wind Eels. A school of wind eel spirits pass around the party, floating on the breeze. They’re generally harmless but they
have been known to gnaw holes in stone buildings.

11

Dandelion Spirits. The wind blows dandelion fluff spirits that get everywhere. The spirits are having the time of their
lives. Some are small enough to tickle nose hairs and make an adventurer sneeze.

12

Hidden Village. Expertly camouflaged in the tall grass is a hidden village of people who have lived here for generations.
They can provide food, shelter, and information about the area. They also may have need of things from outside the Gale
Fields and ask for the party’s assistance.

DOMAIN OF THE FISH
HEAD COVEN

he wilderness of the Gale Fields is home to the domain of the Fish Head Coven, a powerful and secretive league of
witches. Their domain is dotted with their arcane geoglyphs and stone cairns. Its boundaries are marked by a magical
hedgerow that alerts the leaders of the Fish Head Coven when someone crosses it. Gatehouses at the four cardinal directions are built into the hedgerow, each one garrisoned by a trio of witches.
Those who make the journey to the domain usually do so in search of ingredients they might purchase or to seek the counsel of a particular witch whose expertise in a specific corner of arcane knowledge can’t be found elsewhere on the island.

Tone/Vibe
Witchy, Academical, Focused, Mysterious,

Reputation
Most folks on Obojima have no reason to consider this
place at all other than it being a source of strangeness. But
to those who practice magic, the domain of the Fish Head
Coven is quite polarizing. Members of other covens might

admire or resent the most powerful coven’s seat of power,
but most witches envy the arcane secrets they’re certain
must be housed there.

The Witching Tower
At the heart of the domain, the coven makes its headquarters in a set of three brick towers connected by bridges. This
is where witches of the Fish Head Coven have been known
to gather for over a century, exchanging information, brewing potions, and occasionally inducting new members into
the coven.

75

The Council of Three
and Thirty
The comings and goings of the Fish Head Coven are
orchestrated by the Council of Three and Thirty. At any
given time, a trio of powerful witches preside over the
coven along with an amalgamated spirit entity known as
the Thirty. The council is convened to weigh in on matters
of great importance or to formally recognize new coven
witches. The council also has the authority to call upon all
witches of the coven to attend a gathering in the domain.
When one of the council witches dies, a new one is chosen
from among the coven to replace them.

Almanacs
The Fish Head Coven possesses two volumes of Granny Prumple’s Almanac of Island Ingredients (for more on ingredients,
see page 194). In addition to the volume on the Gale Fields,
the coven also looks after the volume on the Shallows.

BRASS EYES

NPCs
Council Witches. The current council presiding over the
Fish Head Coven includes Yolikanter Crogiss—a paranoid
female Nakudama who specializes in warding magic, Bim of
the Beasts—an enigmatic female human of unknown age
who speaks only through animals, and the venerable Brass
Eye—a tiny withered male human whose eyes have been
replaced with brass orbs and who it is said lives in both the
Physical Realm and the Spirit Realm. No living witch knows
Brass Eyes’ real name.
The council witches are almost always present at the
Witches’ Bridge, though they prefer to keep to their own
quarters, convening only when the need arises.
Tan the Apprentice and Abi (male human & spirit).
A newcomer to the Witching Tower and aspiring coven
witch is Tan, the thirteen-year-old human boy who apprentices for the renowned witch Ognev. Tan hails from Amak
Shurak here in the Gale Fields. He was an awkward kid,
who talked to himself constantly. On a visit to the town,
Ognev met Tan and immediately recognized the kid’s gift
for spellcraft. He offered to take Tan on as an apprentice,
and his parents were all too quick to agree. Ognev saw what
everyone else missed. When Tan appears to be talking to
himself, he’s actually speaking to an invisible spirit that’s
always by his side. The spirit is named Abi, and it is quite
protective of Tan. In his apprenticeship, Tan is learning to
become a spirit medium and though he excels, he prefers
Abi’s company to that of other spirits.
Tan and Abi like to sneak out of the Witching Tower at
night and explore the surrounding grounds. Their favorite
spot is an enormous standing stone carved to depict a serpent
coiled around it. At its base is a small niche that Tan uses to
store a small trove of trinkets he’s taken from the tower.
Abi uses the spectral spirit companion stat block.
Wandering Witch Companions (spirits). The Witching
Tower has two resident companion spirits that work with
no one in particular, but are cared for by all. They’ve been
here for as long as anyone remembers, and if they were
companions to a particular witch at one time that witch has
been lost to history. Both companions possess intelligence
comparable to a child. One of them is a highly sociable spirit
cat known as the Lady. The other is the Mighty Peapaleap—a
fat and fluffy long-haired cat who prefers to move about
perched like a loaf on its floating square cushion. The duo
tends to wander the grounds together, but one or the other
will often branch off to follow a visitor it finds interesting.

Points of Interest

a cart that sells potion ingredients. It is run by Ermy Flower,
a Fish Head Coven witch. Ermy is personable and chatty,
particularly toward anyone who’ll talk with her about the
best places to eat on the island. Helping Ermy are her three
magpies, Licorice, Sugar, and Molasses.

The Closed Fists. The Fish Head Coven has two vaults,
about which all kinds of myths have circulated, the most
outlandish is the claim that one of the vaults contains a
bound elder spirit that the witches use as the source of
their power. The coven does little to debunk such theories,
as they only serve to enhance their mystique. The twin
vaults, known as the Closed Fists, are kept deep within
dungeons built into the foundations of the north and south
towers. The northern vault is where the coven keeps the
bulk of its store of ingredients. The domed chamber is lined
with masks, several of which emerge as urugama demons
who are bound to guard the vault.
Meanwhile, the southern vault is where the most dangerous magic items in the coven’s possession are held. Each
item in this vault is attached by a thin, silver chain to a small
silver cage containing a mushroom. If one of these cages is
disturbed, the mushroom inside begins vibrating and, after
10 seconds, it releases a cloud of spores that quickly fills the
vault. Creatures within the cloud of spores must succeed
on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed.
When a creature first steps into the cloud or starts its turn
within the cloud, it must make a saving throw. This effect
lasts for 3 days or until neutralized with a secret concoction
known only to the keeper of the vault. Undead and construct
creatures are not affected by the spores. The cloud of spores
dissipates after 5 minutes.
The Sanctum. Deep below the base of the central tower, at
the bottom of a hidden stone staircase, is a natural cavern
where the covens have kept their history, spells, and arcane
lore for centuries. This secret library, the Sanctum, is
known only to certain members of the covens. The Sanctum is lit with hundreds of magic candles that eternally
burn within small alcoves carved into the twisting halls of
the cavern. Each alcove contains a single, exquisitely carved,
small statue no more than five inches tall.

Each one of these small statues, called a chot-to, contains
a spirit that, like a book, knows a specific piece of knowledge—a spell, a certain event, or a particular ingredient. All
these statues combined make up the arcane lore and history
of the witch covens.
Chot-tos are carved out of many different kinds of stone,
some are of animals and some look like people. Sometimes
a chot-to is carved to look like one of the characters from
the history that it contains.
When a witch wants a particular bit of information, they
must hold a magic keystone, state what they are looking for,
and ask the chot-to to come forward. If the knowledge is
contained within the Sanctum, the chot-to is then whelmed
by its inhabiting spirit, animating the statue, and it hops
from its alcove, scurries over, and begins divulging its lore.
What people don’t know—even most witches—is that
there are always several chot-tos that are listening and
recording every conversation and ritual performed while
in the Sanctum. These spies remain motionless and only
report to the Council of Three and Thirty.

Adventure Hooks
Coven Thief. The adventurers accompany a member of the
Fish Head Coven to the domain so he can attend a gathering of the coven witches. As the gathering concludes,
the witches go their separate ways, but your friend quickly
discovers that his spellbook is gone. He believes it was
stolen by one of the other witches.
Mirror Messenger. The adventurers are waiting in a dim
parlor inside of the Witches’ Bridge. Why they are there is
up to you, but it could be because they seek an audience
with one of the witches in residence, or because they are
delivering something. While waiting, they notice that a fat
cat laying on a floating cushion has been staring at a mirror
for quite some time. After a moment, a youthful human
appears in the mirror and then steps through it into the
parlor with the adventurers. He pleads for their help to
find his little brother who is lost in the Spirit Realm. If the
adventurers agree, he bids them to follow him back through
the mirror, which takes them into the Spirit Realm.
Spirit Journey. You are summoned by Alkun, a resident
witch of the Fish Head Coven who needs your help to
heal Sorolu, an elder spirit made of earth and vines who
is suffering from some unknown malady. The witch says
that one of the party must collect a variety of ingredients
found in the Gale Fields so that they can craft an elixir to
communicate in dreamlike visions with the elder spirit in
hopes of understanding its pain.

THE CRAWLING CANOPY

T

he Crawling Canopy is exactly what the name implies—a massive forest that endlessly meanders, leaving a trail miles
wide in its wake. It is a recent enigma, having appeared within the last 300 years, and most Obojimans who know of the
Crawling Canopy are unsure what powerful magic allows it to move or why it never seems to leave the borders of the
Gale Fields. Many have their speculations, but to most, the forest is yet another unsolved mystery that makes the locals shake
their heads in puzzlement as they shepherd their flock and tend to their beans and pumpkins.
Those who have seen the interior of the forest (and were lucky enough to escape) have said that few creatures live on the
ground. Because the forest moves, most creatures live in the canopy, riding along in the trees as the forest lumbers its way
across the Gale FIelds.
There are days, even months, where the Crawling Canopy will remain in a single spot, almost as if it is tempting the curious
to venture into its depths and uncover its secrets. But for those who cannot resist and enter the forest’s unknown depths, it
almost always ends in folly, as the forest, in an instant, can uproot itself and begin moving again, bewildering any unfortunate
explorers, wanderers, or woodcutters within the confounding swirl of ever-moving trees.

Tone/Vibe
Confusing, Whimsical, Frightening

78

Reputation
The Crawling Canopy for most Obojimans is yet another
strange rumor or myth, that many might wonder if it is
even real. But the closer an adventurer goes to the Gale
Fields, the more real the myth becomes until adventurers
begin to encounter those who have seen the forest—or who
know someone lost within it.

Because of its magical nature and relative danger to
the curious or unwary, the Crawling Canopy is generally
regarded by most Obojimans with a modicum of suspicion
and a good dose of fear.

Magic Wood
As the Crawling Canopy moves along its meandering
path through the Gale Fields, it invariably leaves behind
branches and fallen trees. Although these bits of the Crawling Canopy are dead wood, they still have some of the magic
left within them. But there are many superstitions that talk
of curses and the wrath of the forest spirit, and because of
this, most Obojimans do not touch the wood and leave it
well enough alone.
Despite the warnings, some woodcutters throw caution to
the wind and try to harvest living trees at the edge of the
forest to get wood that is imbued with the forest’s magic.
But the Crawling Canopy is known for being a place where
monsters lurk and tales of woodcutters being snatched
away by demons keep away all but the most courageous or
desperate of lumberjacks.
Here are some properties the wood harvested from
the Crawling Canopy could have:
◊ Dead wood harvested from the forest burns longer
and hotter than normal wood.
◊ Bows fashioned out of living wood are +1 bows.
◊ Arrows made from living wood add 30 feet to the
bow’s range.
◊ If you build a house out of living wood taken from the
wandering trees, the house is powered by the magic of
the wood for several years. These houses magically heat
themselves during the winter, and, in rare circumstances,
have the ability to move at the owners’ command.

The Saved
There is a group of people who live high up within the
canopy who call themselves “the Saved”—a commune that
claims to be “open to all”. The commune is built on a collection of wood and rope scaffolding which surrounds a large,
hollow tree trunk filled with all manner of discarded items
that members call the Trinket Trunk. When anyone wishes
to join the Saved, they must go through a ritual of cleansing that culminates in the candidate walking to the Trinket
Trunk and ridding themselves of all their worldly possessions as “these things are not needed here”.
The Saved have found ways of living in relative comfort
within the forest—although their lives may be deemed
by others as primitive, they appear to be a stable and
functioning community.

You can play the Saved as a helpful band of NPCs
for parties that are lost within the Crawling
Canopy. You can also play the Saved as a cult of
oddballs who are quirky and comical at best or
ominous and dangerous at worst. If you choose to
go “ominous”, then the Saved may have a strange,
magical relationship with the forest. Even going
as far as using the party as an offering to the
heart of the forest.

NPCs
Zeb, Jeb, and Dingus (male Nakudama). These are a
group of “entrepreneurs” who came to the Crawling Canopy
to collect the magical wood and are now hopelessly lost
(although they don’t at first admit it). They heard that
“certain buyers” in Sky Kite Valley would pay a king’s
ransom for a single trunk of a magical moving tree, so they
planned on cutting one down and hauling it back to Sky
Kite to collect their reward. Now, after wandering for
weeks, they just want to get out and return to their simple
life as farmers.
Edgarton Hargreaves III (male human) and the
Council of Kroo (humans). Should adventurers travel
deep enough within the Crawling Canopy, they may happen
upon a group of hermits living in ramshackle tree houses.
Edgarton Hargreaves III is the erudite leader of a group of
crazed hermits known as the Council of Kroo consisting
of: Penelope Mibblethorpe—a witch of considerable power;
Sheldrake Wobbledrain—a warlock who loves toads and
warty things; and Thurston Smorkwaggle—a purveyor of
wondrous fungal delights.
As explained by Edgarton, most of what the Council of
Kroo does is beyond human comprehension as he claims
they hold the cosmos together through various esoteric
and magical means. However as a party endures their mad
chatter, they may catch a bit of useful knowledge amid their
talk of space toads, crystal shards, and journeys deep into
the Spirit Realm.
Slashface and the Barkers (howlers). Slashface is a rough
and tough howler boss with a scar across her face who is
in charge of a howler clan known as the Barkers. Long ago,
after her clan had done a full day of aggressive barking—
chasing cows and scaring villagers—Slashface camped her
gang out in the Gale Fields. But when the Barkers woke up,
they found themselves deep inside the Crawling Canopy.
After a year of trying to find their way out, they eventually did, but after some loud and aggressive conversing
among themselves, they came to the conclusion that this
place was to their liking and worth staying in and so they
walked themselves right back inside.
Morgo (spirit). Morgo is a sage who has been lost within
the Crawling Canopy for almost 20 years. Morgo has studied
the myths and legends of his people and was searching for

79

evidence to support his theory that long ago, there was a
great battle between the Sky King and the demon emperor
of the Nakudama that created a large crater within the Gale
Fields. Morgo believes that proof of this ancient battle lies
somewhere in the forest and that it is just one of the many
secrets the wandering forest holds dear.

The tavern has all the amenities that one would find in
any well-run establishment. Merry puppet musicians play
well into the night, and tireless puppet bartenders keep
the ale flowing. The kitchen serves all kinds of culinary
delights and keeps the fire stoked with magic wood from
the Crawling Canopy.

Bruno (awakened dog). Bruno is the playful and loyal
companion of the wizard brewmaster at the Wicked Wizard
Tavern. In addition to having an amazing palate for ale,
Bruno also has a general understanding of distilling alcohol
and basic magical enchantments. This knowledge, of course,
came through close observation of his master.

Although there are stairs leading up, no one is allowed in
the rooms above. Should an adventurer wish to go up the
stairs, the puppets get nervous and flustered to the point of
begging if need be.
On the second floor is a brewery full of barrels and
copper pots for brewing Wicked Wizard Small Batch Magic
Ale. They also find an awakened dog, Bruno, who used to
be the companion of the Wicked Wizard but who now is
masquerading as him.

Adventure Hooks
BRUNO

Though no coven claims the woods as an
outpost, several coven witches from all across
the island study within the forest. Whether
for broom and wand crafting or ingredient research, the shambling trees are known to draw
the attention of the magically inclined.

Points of Interest
Wicked Wizard Tavern. The Wicked Wizard Tavern is a
tall, ramshackle tower that’s been jammed between two
old-growth trees. The bottom floor is a tavern from which
the building gets its name, while the upper floor is a wizard’s
laboratory, study, quarters, and the Wicked Wizard Brewery.
It would seem that the Wicked Wizard Tavern only reveals
itself to those it wishes to. Adding to its mystery is the fact
that the barkeep and the servers are all animated, wooden
puppets made from the forest’s magical trees. Rumors are
that the Wicked Wizard needed staff for the tavern so he
crafted marionette helpers. Others say that marionettes are
the wizard’s unruly customers, who were turned into pleasant and helpful wooden puppets.

80

The Missing Wizard. After some discussion with Bruno
at the Wicked Wizard Tavern, the adventurers find out that
the proprietor of the establishment has mysteriously disappeared and now Bruno is doing his best to keep the tavern
and the wizard’s brewhouse going. Bruno only has a cursory
understanding of brewing ale, and it’s only a matter of time
before their reserves run out and Bruno must brew a batch
by himself. Bruno is desperate for help and is just trying to
be a very good boy.
Paralyzing Fear. Trapped within the center of three
watchwood trees is an unlucky traveler who has been
paralyzed by the trees’ gaze. Though the traveler can’t call
out for help, it’s clear they’ve been stuck like this for days.
It’s unknown how long they can hold up while enduring
this torturous treatment.
Runaway Stump. One of the forest trees has been cut
down and now its stump has uprooted itself and is on a
rampage throughout the forest floor, causing mayhem and
drawing attention from those around it.
Lost Within The Crawling Canopy. This is one of the
adventures included in this book (see page 360).

THE BRACKWATER
WETLANDS
On the eastern reaches of Obojima, lies the mist-shrouded Brackwater Wetlands. Ruined settlements lie sinking in the
murky waters, their weathered wooden stilts snapped by the recent tsunami which flooded the area and left behind a salty
brine that soaks the gnarled trunks of broken trees.
Since the seismic upheaval and the tsunami’s wrath, a sinister new addition known as the Corruption has tainted this
landscape. It has spread its tendrils across the wetlands, twisting and warping everything it touches, birthing living manifestations—corrupted muk—among the flora and fauna, and ensnaring unwary travelers in its suffocating embrace.
Even before the tsunami occurred, the howler and monster-ridden swampland was warily traveled by islanders, one of the
many reasons the area has little to no towns or villages. Despite all this, those who journeyed through the wetlands could find
the occasional respite at places like Haukan’s Ramen Shop, a lantern-lit sanctuary for those who dare to brave the haunted
depths of the Brackwater Wetlands.

Wandering Encounters
Roll

Wandering Encounter

1

Mud Eel Fishing. A group of fishers offers to share tales and freshly caught mud eels (use the animalistic spirit stat
block in this book) in exchange for news from beyond the wetlands. Since the tsunami, they are managing to survive on
their wits and knowledge of the wetlands.

2

Quicksand! Whether by bad luck, being chased by a monster, or lured by a tricksy spirit, the party must deal with this
environmental danger.

3

Hakumon’s Hospitality. The party stumbles upon Hakumon’s Ramen Shop. Hakumon offers a hearty meal and shelter for
the night, but warns of the nearby Corruption’s advance.

4

Unlikely Train Stop. Partially submerged in the mud is a lonesome platform and train stop. Sitting on the partially broken
bench is an old man quietly reading a book and waiting for the Wandering line. (see below)

5

Railroad Passage. The party finds an entrance to the underground subway system that can be found in parts of the Brackwater wetlands. (see Goodie Mart below).

6

Muk Ambush. 1d4 Corrupted Muk ambush the party from under the swamp.

7

Crawlers. The party encounters 1d4 Crawlers.

8

Borgork. The party has stumbled into the territory of Borgork, a haughty and imperious young Dragon Frog who claims
to rule this part of the Brackwater Wetlands. They must appease Borgork with tribute and flattery or suffer his wrath.

9

Missing Villager. A woodcutter who was with Grifftang Crump (see “Polewater Village” below) got separated and is huddled in the hollow of a broken tree, clinging to life. They fled a howler attack, got disoriented, and now have no idea how
to get back home.

10

Bubbling Below. Suddenly the ground below the party's feet starts to feel like mud as black pools of Corruption seep from
the ground like a sponge being squeezed. Anyone caught in it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save
the creature gains a level of exhaustion.

11

Lion’s Blume. The party encounters one (or several) lion’s blume vines. Entangled in one of them is a missing resident
from Polewater who is calling for help.

12

Roakraska. The party encounters the gulper eel spirit, Roakraska (see “Polewater Village” below).

CORRUPTED COASTLINE

T

he once pristine south-eastern coastline of Obojima is now the site of an unsettling encroachment of what Obojimans
who have experienced it call “the Corruption”. A black, tar-like substance that can shimmer in iridescent purples, greens,
or reddish-orange veins.

The Corruption appeared three months ago after an island-shaking earthquake that was then followed by a tsunami. Soon
after the waters receded, a gigantic surge of this Corruption emerged from the sea and bubbled up onto the shores, oozing
inland for several miles and leaving a thick swath of muck-covered devastation in its wake.
Although its initial surge was swift, over time, some areas of Corruption appear to have slowed down, and in certain places
it appears to have stopped completely.

Tone/Vibe
Eerie, Dark, Unsettling

Reputation
Most Obojimans west of the Gale Fields are unaware of the
corrupted coastline and may have only heard wild rumors
of it. The farther east of the Gale Fields you go, the more
concerned people are with it.
Those who have seen the Corruption or who have been
directly impacted by it are most likely trying to survive its
impact or they are simply fleeing for their lives and hoping
it goes away so they might one day return to their homes.
As to what Obojimans think the Corruption is or its
cause, speculations are many and varied.

82

Evidence of Disaster

◊ You can touch a corrupted thing—like a tree, creature, or
human—and not get corrupted.

Information is limited as to how far the Corruption has
spread and how it is affecting wildlife and people, only
members of the Courier Brigade and AHA are beginning to
comprehend the full extent of the Corruption’s invasion.
Those who once lived on the eastern coast are now mostly
refugees having fled to the middle and westerly parts of the
island, but they are among the only Obojimans who have
first-hand information about this wretched sludge.

◊ If you stay in a corrupted area for a long period of time,
and you are careful not to touch the Corruption, you
won’t get corrupted, but you may suffer weird side effects.
Having special armor, potions, or spells can eliminate the
risk of incurring a condition or ill-effect.

For an adventurer who asks, they will hear grim tales of
forests turning into stagnant, barren fens, their creatures
and plant life withered and mutated. The strangest thing,
they say, when you walk into a forest afflicted with the
Corruption is that you no longer hear the animal sounds or
see their movement. Now, there is only silence and sorrow
among the blackened shrubs and slime-covered trunks.

The Spread of the
Corruption
The Corruption’s spread has nearly come to a stop on the
island. When it first arrived through the tsunami it was
hurled across the Brackwater Wetlands, casting a wide net,
but since that day the Corruption’s spread has been a slow
crawl across the floor of the island. The Corruption has,
however, in the last month been appearing deeper into
the woods, as it is being carried by infected creatures or
sentient forms of the Corruption known as Corrupted Muk
and Vile Corruption.

Sickness
Creatures that come in contact with the Corruption for
more than a few minutes can develop a harrowing illness,
otherwise known as being “corrupted”—though it is
unclear how the Corruption affects different creatures,
most suffer from a wide variety of symptoms. At best, it
seems humanoids can develop life-altering side effects,
while in the worst-case scenario, corrupted humanoids die
within a few days. These, however, are just the effects on
humanoids. Beastial creatures have been seen fully skeletonized, stripped of any personality or higher intelligence
and leaving them with basic instincts, while spirits seem
to undergo a form of madness, which inevitably leads to a
demonic transformation.
Mages and scholars are working tirelessly to determine how
the Corruption functions, but there are still so many questions to be answered. What is known is listed below:
◊ Touching the Corruption doesn’t mean that you’re
infected, but the longer you have direct contact with it,
the more chance it has of infecting you.
◊ The Corruption doesn’t spread through the air. You can
breathe in a corrupted zone and not get infected.

◊ If a humanoid is infected, it isn’t always all downside.
The Corruption has this strange way of taking things
and giving things. In certain circumstances, in addition
to more standard symptoms and negative effects, the
Corruption can grant powers that seem connected to the
negative symptoms the infected is experiencing.

What is it Doing?
Since coming ashore, some parts of the Corruption have
ceased to move horizontally and have started seeping
down into the ground. Very few people know of this, with
just a handful of AHA members who are actively studying
the Corruption being aware of this phenomenon. AHA’s
research suggests the Corruption is sinking deeper and
deeper into the heart of the island.

AHA Theories
AHA members theorize the following:
◊ The Corruption might be seeping into the groundwater
and using it to move throughout Obojima—polluting
wells and springs as it goes.
◊ The Corruption seems to be in contact with itself and some
AHA members theorize that, if stimulated sufficiently, it
might be able to respond as one massive organism.
◊ Some AHA members fear that it is hunting for the source
of Obojima’s life force—the spirit of the island.

NPCs
Olundu (demon). Spirits are exceedingly vulnerable to the
effects of the Corruption and elder spirits are no exception.
Olundu, a giant tree sloth, was once an elder spirit that
protected and tended to a wondrous grove of ancient bashu
trees known as Ten Wheels Grove—a once beautiful area
that has now become ravaged by the tendrils of thick slime.
Olundu became afflicted and slowly rotted away until he
turned into a demon.
Now, Olundu prowls his ruined grove, a shaggy, oil-covered predator with unnatural swiftness and a desire to
harm. He lurks in the blackened canopy, vomiting Corruption on unsuspecting prey below before he pounces on
them, tearing his prey asunder with his talons.
Bim of the Beasts (female human). A member of the
Fish Head Coven, Bim of the Beasts can be found here
collecting and studying the Corruption (see “Domain of the
Fish Head Coven”, above). Bim is very concerned about the

83

well-being of all beasts in the wake of this disaster, and she
has constructed a makeshift laboratory on the fringes of the
corrupted coastline where she tries to rehabilitate afflicted
animals while studying the Corruption’s effects on them.
Bloop (beast). Bloop is a weird skeletonized fish that
follows the party like a stray dog.
Gnasher (howler). Gnasher is a howler chieftain (use the
howler snarler stat block) who was caught in the initial
flood of Corruption. He is now a wraith-like version of his
former self who laps up Corruption as if it were a delicacy.

AHA is working hard all along the corrupted
coastline to try and answer all the burning
questions. Where did it come from? What is
it made of? How can it be stopped? In their
efforts to get answers, many AHA members
have succumbed to the Corruption, so their
motivation to find a cure is very high. That
said, their numbers are limited, and with
more and more researchers getting ill, the
organization is questioning if this type of
research is sustainable.

After the earthquake and the subsequent
tsunami, the established paths through this
already treacherous area have been almost
entirely washed away. Because of this, the
Courier Brigade is now struggling to cross
through the Brackwater Wetlands and, in
the last few months, has lost several dozen
members in the corrupted swamps.

Brim of Beasts, one of the fish head coven’s
most influential witches, is swampland testing
and sampling the Corruption. Although she
originally came to see if the Corruption had
any magical properties or uses in potion brewing, she stayed to assist the creatures affected
by the encroaching Corruption.

Points of Interest
Gobo Village. On the eastern coastline, there is a village
that is now a ruin, devastated by the tsunami and earthquake. Black pools of Corruption snake along every abandoned street and infest the crumbled walls of every empty
home. Despite the danger, a single, mad druid still lives
here. For some reason, unknown to the druid, he is not
affected by the Corruption’s magics. Instead, he is plagued
by horrific memories that haunt him. At night, the druid
claims demons overrun the town, but even he can’t be sure
it’s not all in his mind.
Sunken Village Graveyard. Just offshore, in the blackened,
corrupted water, boats bob on the surface, held there by

84

sticky strands of the Corruption that are anchored to the
village that sits under 15-feet of water. This was once the
village of Ekmu, home to a sacred Nakudama temple that
now rests on the seafloor. Corrupted fish folk have gathered
here as has a demon by the name of Slaathti, who takes the
form of a giant eel and has claimed the sunken village as
her lair.
The Shade Wood. The section of the woods lying close to
the coastline has become desaturated and abandoned. Once
a living, breathing swamp, it now feels cold and empty, a
home to the Corrupted Muk and wayward spirits who are
slowly being forced into new demonic forms.

Adventure Hooks
Desperate Measures. Refugees from various small villages
have collected in a small campsite in the middle of the Shade
Wood. Nearly perishing in the disaster, the group has only
survived due to the efforts of a ranger and a local druid,
who stumbled on the group over a month ago. The druid
and ranger have single-handedly saved the refugees from
the encroaching Corruption and the dark creatures that now
dwell in the woods. They are both exhausted, having been
working around the clock to both defend the campsite and
provide nourishment and basic medical treatment for the
group. The ranger is suffering from advanced stages of illness
due to contact with the Corruption but is using the last
vestiges of her strength to keep the camp safe.
As if their situation wasn’t bad enough, at night a
band of skeletonized howlers opportunistically
pick off the weak and exhausted. Both the druid
and ranger believe it’s only a matter of time before
the dangers of the woods overrun their camp, so
they’ve been preparing to make the pilgrimage
to safety.
It Takes a Village. During the events of
the earthquake, tsunami, and the
thick flood of Corruption that
surged inland, an entire village
with all its people collapsed,
and the pile of wreckage
became an enormous rubble
golem. This golem now sits
amid the broken lodgepoles
and ruined roads where the
village once stood, confused
and mourning. Though it could
be dispatched by combat,
cleansing the village of
Corruption could also put
the golem to rest.

POLEWATER VILLAGE

ntil the tsunami crashed against the eastern side of Obojima months ago, Polewater was a thriving fishing village built
on stilts in a sheltered lagoon on the east side of the island. It was home to more than a hundred residents and a small
fleet of high-prowed fishing boats. Most Obojimans know little of the village except for these distinct vessels, which
appeared regularly at seaside settlements across Obojima, where the village’s fisherfolk—recognized by their vibrant caps and
scarves—sold the day’s catch.
But the boats from Polewater haven’t been seen since the tsunami. News has been difficult to come by, and rumors have
since swelled. Some claim the whole village was swallowed up by the sea, while others believe Polewater has fallen under the
spell of a charismatic but isolationist leader who prefers to keep the village’s bounty out of the hands of outsiders.
What is known is that communication between Polewater and the rest of the island has ceased. The Courier Brigade’s roads
through the Brackwater Wetlands were washed away with the tsunami, and cross-country travel has proven too dangerous.
The sea routes, too, have become impassable due to increased belligerence from fish folk on either side of the island.

Tone/Vibe
Mournful, Lost, Needing Hope, Disheartened

Above the Danger
The Brackwater Wetlands is a notoriously dangerous region,
with its treacherous terrain and monsters the likes of which
folk living on the rest of the island would scarcely believe
to be real. And yet, Polewater has existed for many generations as an enclave of safety between the wetlands and the
sea. They mitigate the danger by building their dwellings on
stilts in the middle of New Moon Lagoon. The whole village
is a tangle of interconnected gangways and catwalks that
run between each structure.

85

Not only is Polewater still reeling from the tsunami, but
it is also the closest settlement to the Corruption. Fisherfolk reel in skeletonized fish and many villagers exhibit
the telltale signs of the Corruption’s ill effects. Polewater is a village in crisis, and its location in the Brackwater
Wetlands makes it particularly vulnerable to the dangers
that surround it. The village’s young leader is doing his best
to keep his people safe, while, unknown to him, his young
sister has embraced the Corruption, much to the peril of all
the folk in Polewater.

Tsunami Aftermath
In its heyday, Polewater was a village that lived off the
sea. Dozens of timber structures crowded together on the
stilt-supported platforms that the village is named for.
It boasted a lively marina and the smell of fish and salt
mingled with the meandering tunes strummed out on
guitars here and answered from fishing boats returning
with the morning catch.
But that’s all gone now. The inhabitants of Polewater were
not new to tsunamis and their village’s design had been
successful during many previous tsunamis. However, this
tsunami was stronger than any on record and the earthquake and power of the ensuing waters washed the marina
away and leveled most of the village. Splintered pilings
were all that remained of Polewater’s wooden supports.
The onrushing seawater shattered the village’s fishing boats
against the splintered stilts or swept them far inland to
settle in the muck of the wetlands.
At least thirty villagers died in the destruction wrought
by the tsunami. The numbers might even be higher
because several fisherfolk were at sea when the tsunami
struck, and no one knows if they were caught up in it or if
they managed to survive. Most villagers were left without
homes, and the few structures that remained were transformed into makeshift clinics in the tsunami’s immediate
aftermath. Some folks left Polewater as refugees, but most
stayed, hoping to start over.
Most villagers live in tents near the shore of the lagoon that
had been home to the village. The tents are clustered around
a small central fire pit where folks gather for meals. Stacks of
freshly milled lumber lay in piles strewn about the settlement
while rows and rows of tree stumps litter the shoreline.
The few structures that survived the tsunami and still
stand in the lagoon can be reached by skiff. New construction
on the stilt supports is underway, but it’s been slow going.

A Reluctant Leader
After the tsunami, many who were out fishing on that day
did not return. Among the missing were the village leader
Clarence Ebbs and his wife, Grace. When they did not
return, their sixteen-year-old son, Ernest Ebbs, suddenly
found himself thrust into the position of village leader at
the most difficult time in the village’s history.

86

Although Ernest is young and inexperienced, Polewater
tradition is clear—he must bear the responsibility that his
elders have trained him for. The village is looking to Ernest
for guidance in recovering from this disaster and helping
Polewater rebuild. Amid all of this, Ernest must also take
care of his young sister, Madelaine, who has been acting
disturbingly odd as of late (see “Madelaine” below).

Rebuilding Polewater
The efforts to rebuild the village are hampered, as the debris
from the tsunami is still being cleared and, due to the
destruction, villagers must roam deeper into the wetlands
to find timbers, as the trees near the shoreline are either
too small are not proper for building. Because of this, they
are encountering demons and howler bands which makes
the rebuilding process all the more perilous. Feeding everyone is also a challenge as fisherfolk have to sail farther and
farther afield as fish in the area are now skeletonized due
to the Corruption or cause a strange sickness to those that
eat them. This wider roaming has caused them to encounter
marauding bands of viperfish folk flying the tattered banner
of Venomous Rex.

Madelaine
Ernest’s 8-year-old sister, Madelaine, has had an entirely
different reaction to the tsunami and ensuing Corruption
that has destroyed her village and her family.
In the aftermath of the tsunami, it was believed that
Madelaine had also been taken by the waves, but the day
after the destruction, she walked out of the ocean holding
a spirit companion, an anglerfish she calls Silt (see “Silt” in
NPCs below).
Since that day, Madelaine rarely speaks and when she
does, she talks about the Corruption as an almost kindly
creature, saying it is only trying to make things live again.
She often points to the skeletal fish and says that the dead
fish are swimming again and that it can be the same for
everyone and no one has to die.
At first, the villagers attributed Madelaine’s odd and
unsettling behavior to the shock of the village’s destruction
and the trauma of losing her parents, but Madeline has now
manifested strange powers and the villagers are starting
to tell a different story. Madelaine’s fascination with the
Corruption (and her immunity to it) is causing serious upset
as Madelaine wants to “give it to everyone” and has walked
around, innocently holding out handfuls of the toxic muck
that she has scooped up off of the seafloor to horrified
villagers. Some believe her to be the key to a cure but many
are beginning to think that the real Madelaine died
in the tsunami and this imposter is a demon or changeling
in disguise.
Because he loves his sister, Ernest puts out these fires of
discord as best he can, but his sister’s actions continually
create new problems for him and he’s becoming exasperated.

NPCs
Ernest Ebbs (male human). Ernest has been thrust into
a position of leadership and now must care for the well-being of his village and deal with the disturbing behavior of
his younger sister, Madelaine. Ernest isn’t sure that he’s
cut out for either job and teeters on the edge of uncertainty
and doubt as to whether he can bring Polewater and his
sister back to normal. Being under this stress makes Ernest
impatient, irritable, and resentful as he tries to navigate a
seemingly endless host of problems.
Madelaine (female human). Madelaine has undergone a
strange transformation where she can now commune with
the Corruption alongside other abnormal abilities. In her
child mind, she believes that the Corruption “makes everything alive again” and she can’t understand why everyone is
so mad at it.
Silt (spirit). Silt is a spirit companion that saved Madelaine when she was sucked out into the ocean by the
tsunami. Despite Silt’s anglerfish-like appearance, he is very
kind and protective of Madelaine and is always seeking to
do the right thing for his companion. When Madelaine is
underwater communing with the Corruption, Silt has an
ability that grants only his companion water breathing.
Grifftang Crump (male human). Grifftang Crump is a
hard-as-nails woodcutter who is overseeing the resourcegathering effort for rebuilding the city. He’s a burly fellow
known for his constitution and skill with his ancestral axe
named Mojo, so he has volunteered to
go deeper into the Brackwater
Wetlands where the Corruption is thickest to chop down
trees and slay anything that threatens the village. Despite
all his encounters with the Corruption,
Grifftang has resisted being infected.

Ermina Flopfoot (female Nakudama). Ermina is a
Crowsworn witch who is watching Madelaine closely. She
believes that the girl could either hold the cure for the
Corruption or, a more likely case, that she will soon become
a demon. Ermina has studied many ancient Nakudama
texts that speak of Oghmai, the Demon Emperor, and she
believes that Madelaine is suffering from the same sickness
that twisted Oghmai and turned him into a demon.
Roakraska. Roakraska is a skeletonized gulper eel that was
hurled by the tsunami deep into the Brackwater Wetlands.
She now slithers through the dark canopy of the corrupted
trees ready to ambush and inhale her victims in one
terrifying gulp.

Also known as the swamp witches, the Crowsworn Coven had traditionally kept its base of
operations in Polewater, but its headquarters
was obliterated during the tsunami. Now, only
Ermina Flopfoot remains and she is dubious as
to whether the coven will rebuild here or not.

Points of Interest
Makeshift Lab. Ernest has created a small hut where he
studies anything and everything related to the Corruption.
He is trying to find a cure as well as understand what has
befallen his sister.
Beached Ship. About a mile north of Polewater along the
debris-strewn beach is a 100-foot ship—the Sally Sue—that
has been washed ashore and lies buried in sand and shattered tree limbs. Villagers have been too afraid to enter
the ship, as there are signs of Corruption on it and it could
already be claimed by Venomous Rex, but many are beginning to become desperate as the ship’s timbers could be of
great use in rebuilding the village.

Adventure Hooks
Help Bring Supplies. A band of Rangers from the Greenward Path are attempting to bring relief to Polewater but
finding a road or path not destroyed by the tsunami is proving a slow and dangerous task. Any help to get supplies into
Polewater is greatly appreciated as is apprehending or chasing
off any opportunistic marauders lurking in the wetlands.
Help Rebuild Polewater. This is an epic task that can
contain many different types of quests and missions:
ERNEST &
MADELAINE
EBBS

◊ Take a villager to Tidewater to learn the spell Sand
Structure so they can rebuild the breakwater and marina
of Polewater.
◊ Help Grifftang cut down trees or defend him and some
villagers as they do so.
◊ Deal with the gulper eel, Roakraska. This could involve
conflict with Madelaine who has bonded with the giant eel.

W

GOODIE MART

ithin the Brackwater Wetlands is the Moloda Woods—a primordial forest often shrouded in mist. Should travelers
wander deep enough, they might come across the dimly flickering lights of the Goodie Mart at the edge of the dank,
still waters of Murglove Fen.

The Goodie Mart is an ancient relic of the First Age, a place where thirsty and hungry travelers might have once stopped for
respite. Now the Goodie Mart stands eerily empty, a bleached skeleton from another time with a single vending machine as
its silent companion and, like most relics of the First Age, still standing despite times cruel effects.
The Goodie Mart is still magically lit, and its neon signs sputter into life every now and then. Moth spirits also illuminate
the shop, their faintly glowing wings fluttering in the gloom. Of those rare few who have seen the Goodie Mart, almost all
believe it to be a cursed place, and no one has dared set foot within it. Over time, it has become a place of myth and legend,
with all manner of stories surrounding it—tales that range from the mildly bizarre to the highly unsettling.

Tone/Vibe
Weird, Unsettling, Eerie, Dangerous

Reputation
Only those who have traveled or lived within the Brackwater Wetlands have heard of this strange and unusual place.
Most believe it to be cursed by the spirits, and those who
have actually seen it say that it had an unearthly feel that
gave them a chill down their spine.
Outside of the Bracken Wetlands, the legend of the
Goodie Mart is almost unheard of.

88

Exploring the
Goodie Mart
Relics and buildings from the First Age are often thought
by Obojimans to be magic by nature as they often exhibit
strange properties, the most obvious of these is their functioning state and lack of decay and rot that affect other
mundane structures. The Goodie Mart is no exception in
this magic ability to resist the weathering of the elements.
But some believe that the Goodie Mart has gone one step
further and that the magic of the First Age has made it into
a locus that attracts bizarre spirits and uncanny creatures.
Goodie Mart Interior. Should an adventurer be bold
enough to open one of the doors to the Goodie Mart, they
will immediately notice that the interior is strangely clean
and has a subtle, luminescent glow. A quick visual search
of the place yields nothing except the usual items within
a convenience store. Still, if adventurers begin to poke and
prod about, they will find a unique passage hidden within
the relic. Behind the foggy glass of the refrigerator door
are steps that descend in a series of switchbacks down a
tile-covered tunnel to a ruined subway station far below.

The Ruined Subway
The ruined subway system is a bizarre wonderland ruled
by an elder spirit called Gomura, a massive worm-like
monster with a humanoid face. The subway exists in
darkness, but when Gomura is near, the ancient fluorescent lights blink and flicker back into life, bathing the
subway with a pale, artificial glare. The subway has miles
of tunnels and tracks, used by Gomura who slithers along
the rails, moaning and muttering to itself. Many of the
subway tunnels are still usable, but some have tree roots
hanging down from the ceiling, and others have totally
collapsed. Gomura has also made tunnels of its own as it
claws through the rock in an incessant search for its missing heart (see “Gomura’s Heart” below).

freshly dug tunnels, and while the yokario are smaller in
stature than the howlers, they are more numerous and are
led by a much craftier and cunning leader.
Each band has its own sections of the subway system that
they have claimed for themselves, and both the howlers and
yokario have manufactured their own makeshift pump cars
and rail trolleys so they can move with some speed down
the tracks—an essential tool for escaping Gomura.
Underground Treasure. Every now and then in its digging,
Gomura exposes a vein of precious crystals or ore which
gives the howlers and yokario more reasons to squabble.
But they have to be careful as Gomura has more than once
devoured a careless or greedy band of miners as it is drawn
to vibration and noise.

NPCs
Gomura (spirit). Gomura is a disturbed and monstrous
elder spirit that has claimed the ruined subway for its
domain while it looks for its missing heart. Gomura was
once intelligent but since losing its heart ages ago, it has
become quite mad and is now a dangerous and unstable
monster. Because of its missing heart, Gomura devours
anything it finds in an attempt to fill the hole that aches
within itself. Most of the time, Gomura sits in one of its
tunnels and bemoans its missing heart, feeling the ache of
its absence and wondering how it can fill its terrible void.
One way Gomura fills its void is by devouring praise and
attention. Once an adventurer engages with Gomura, they
are trapped, for should they stop talking to it or try to leave
the conversation, Gomura will devour them.

It may be because of Gomura and its magical influence that
the subway, unlike the Goodie Mart, exists in a ruined state.
The Wandering Line. The Wandering Line makes the
occasional stop here and when it does, it magically transforms the world around it to reveal what the subway station
looked like back in the First Age. Before it even arrives, the
restorative magic returns the subway to its former glory—
any dust is banished, missing tiles are restored, subway
signs light up, colors brighten, and even sounds over the
now-defunct intercom begin to chime. But as the train
leaves, things return to their dilapidated state. For more
information on the Wandering Line, see page 113.

GOMURA

Howlers and Yokario. There are several monsters that live
down here, notably howlers and yokario, both of which fear
Gomura. Both these monster groups squabble and bicker
among one another as to which gang gets to rule Gomura’s

89

Ning Ning (Yokario). Ning Ning is a cunning yokario who
is trying to figure out a way to get rid of Gomura so that she
can claim the gold and crystal veins that the worm-monster has uncovered in its tunneling. She knows of Gomura’s
missing heart after hearing the worm endlessly wailing
about it and believes that if she can find it and destroy it,
Gomura will cease to exist. If Ning Ning meets any adventurers, she will try and sway them to her cause.
Chumpah (howler). Chumpah is a howler boss who
worships Gomura as a god. Chumpah believes that Gomura
has chosen him for a great mission—to find its heart. When
he finds this heart, Chumpa believes that Gomura will use
magic to make Chumpah the most powerful howler ever.
But Chumpah knows that Gomura eats howlers, a sobering
fact that has Chumpah puzzled. But Chumpah is not a quitter and he has figured out that finding his god’s heart will
please Gomura. Chumpah looks forward to the day when he
is given magic strength by Gomura so he can punch yokario
harder and eat more food.

Points of Interest
If adventurers wish to brave the howler bands, yokario
gangs, or Gomura, they can travel along the subway tunnels
to other ruined stations. Each one of these stations has
something of interest and perhaps clues to other quests or
adventures.
Here are a few possibilities of some other stations along
the subway line:
◊ This station has an old Nakudama mural which tells the
tale of how a Nakudama army imprisoned a great demon
deep below the mountain.
◊ This station has a small kiosk where a stoic spirit lives,
a master sushi chef who serves world-class spirit sushi.
This chef could possibly provide one of the rare ingredients like Crimson Octopus Ink, a Giant Koi Fish Scale, or
Lionfish Poison.
◊ This station has a magic ticket machine that dispenses
strange information on its tickets. It could also dispense
tickets for a ride on the Wandering Line (see “Wandering
Line” below).

Adventure Hooks
Gomura’s Heart. While traveling through the subway,
adventurers are bound to hear about Gomura’s heart, either
from one of the factions that live in the subway or from
Gomura itself.
Though the constant digging by the inhabitants of the
subway would make it seem like the heart was buried deep
within the many interwoven tunnels, the truth is the heart
hasn’t been seen in centuries.
Some bards claim to have seen the heart many years ago
as a featured attraction of a traveling show, while others
believe it was swallowed by a stone whale who rests deep
below the earth—there are even claims that it was traded
to the coal master on the Wandering Line. Whether these
rumors have some truth to them or not, Gomura seems to
believe their heart is somewhere inside the subway.

HAKUMON’S
RAMEN SHOP

O

n the eastern side of Obojima, in the foothills of the Coastal Highlands, there’s a long, desolate stretch of dirt road,
known as Pelican Way, that never seems to get overgrown. At one end of it, there’s a ramen shop called Hakumon’s,
that only opens when the sun begins to set.

The shop itself is a relic of the First Age, a simple and solidly built wood structure specially made for serving ramen. There’s
plenty of seats along the polished, wood bar that sits right next to the cooking area where Hakumon, a large ogre-like spirit
of few words, works to create and serve his noodle and broth masterpieces. While Hakumon cooks and serves his clientele, a
cadre of small spirit creatures constantly move to and from the back of the shop, bringing fresh ingredients, taking away used
dishes, filling glasses, and making sure the shop is tidy, allowing Hakumon to focus entirely on his art.

Reputation
For anyone who has a serious love of ramen, Hakumon’s
Ramen Shop is a place spoken of in tones of great reverence.
Few have ever been there however, as the pilgrimage to
Hakumon’s shop in the Brackwater Wetlands can be perilous. But for those who have experienced Hakumon’s, their
stories carry the legend throughout Obojima.

Hakumon’s
Ramen Broth
Hakumon sells his famous broth in 10 gallon barrels to
witches for brewing potions. Although Hakumon never
makes anything that is not of the highest quality, the ramen
that you get by coming to his shop is—according to most
Obojiman restaurateurs—head and shoulders above his
commercial broth that he sells.

NPCs
Hakumon, Ramen Chef. Hakumon is imposing but on the
inside he is an artist of the highest caliber seeking only to
perfect ramen and please his customers. Hakumon may be
gruff but he knows how to make guests feel welcome, and
he personally greets everyone who enters his ramen shop,
and personally ejects anyone who causes trouble. If you are
a paying client, you are treated as an honored guest and he
never serves a bowl of ramen that isn’t his best.

Mr. Noka Noka. A doppelganger and notorious ramen
thief, Mr. Noka Noka is always on the lookout for secrets
to Hakumon’s famous ramen broth. He is getting close
to figuring out the many secrets needed to reproduce the
broth, and only a few closely guarded secrets remain. But
Mr. Noka Noka has begun to waver in his resolve to steal
Hakumon’s recipe.
Although Mr. Noka Noka is crafty, Hakumon can see
through him and has served him despite his nefarious
intentions. Hakumon has a soft spot for changelings and
oddballs, and over time has been winning Mr. Noka Noka
over to the point that Mr. Noka Noka has become one of
his most loyal customers and can speak to the nuance and
mastery of Hakumon’s broth more than most ramen experts.

Points of Interest
The Mystery of Pelican Way. Despite being out in the
Bracken Wetlands, Pelican Way and its surroundings never
get overgrown by weeds, shrubs, or trees that grow and
flourish here. Because of this, most Obojimans are fearful
that Pelican Way is somehow cursed, especially after the
Corruption overtook the eastern shores of Obojima. But
shortly after the Corruption, Hakumon shockingly moved
his ramen shop, and with the greatest ramen on Obojima
now on Pelican Way, people began to slowly and reluctantly
adjust their views.
The Ancient Spring. Behind Hakumon’s ramen shop, in a
copse of trees at the base of a hill is a bubbling spring where
Hakumon’s scrublings go to get water for the ramen broth.
The scrublings only do this in the dead of night and in
secret, taking great pains not to be seen as the spring water
is one of the secrets to Hakumon’s legendary ramen broth.
The scrublings dive into the spring and then wring themselves out in the roller back at the shop.

Hakumon is an oni sorcerer who has pushed his magic to
the point of no return and has transformed himself into an
oni. His reasons for doing this are complex, as Hakumon is
never seen to practice magic of any kind, as his philosophy
for making ramen is to use only natural materials.
Hakumon is the elder brother of Chisuay, the proprietor
of Chisuay’s Teahouse in the Land of Hot Water.
Scrublings. Scrublings are a group of small helper spirits
that make sure Hakumon’s Ramen Shop is kept clean and
sparkling. They mostly look like little scrubbing pads with
legs that run about and gobble up any scrap of food, gather
the dishes and jump with them into the sudsy water for a
good scrubbing. Larger scrublings use their shaggy bodies
to sweep in and around the shop like spinning tops. While
scrublings can understand basic commands, they speak in
squeaks, trills, with the occasional sigh or groan.

Rumors

The Ultimate Ramen. If adventurers frequent Hakumon’s
often enough, they will eventually hear tales about the
ultimate ingredient—the rare mushroom known as a Hand
of Eryo. It’s rare that Hakumon will talk more than a few
words, but describing the woody and earthy aroma of a Hand
of Eryo mushroom and how it completes a bowl of ramen is
something that brings forth the poet within him. When he
mentions this mushroom, his spirit staff will pause in their
duties and listen with rapt attention as Hakumon describes
the delights of the Hand of Eryo.

No one dares ask Hakumon about his brother out of respect,
or fear of what the oni might do to one so rude, nor does
the subject of his once being a human sorcerer enter the
conversation. Because of this, Hakumon is a quiet enigma,
a creature purely dedicated to pursuing excellence, all but
dead to his past. For those rare few who know the secret of
his brother and their falling out, there is no hint of anger or
resentment that can be felt within the hulking chef, only,
perhaps, a mere hint every now and then of a deep and
soulful sorrow.

Should an adventurer bring Hakumon a cluster of Hand of
Eryo mushrooms, he will be deeply honored, and there will
occur on Obojima a moment of legend where the greatest
bowls of ramen, perhaps across all universes, will be created.
The first time anyone consumes one of these bowls permanently increases their CON by 1.
Brotherly Love. Although not many know of the connection, Hakumon is the brother of Chisuay, the proprietor of
Chisuay’s Teahouse in the Land of Hot Water. Long ago, the
brothers had a falling out and have never spoken to one
another since.
Unlike his flamboyant brother, Chisuay, Hakumon
prefers his oni form and does nothing to hide it from
even the most timid of customers—and here in the
Bracken Wetlands, travelers are less likely to recoil at the
sight of an oni, perhaps one of the reasons why Hakumon
chose this place to establish his ramen shop as the wetland
folk are a more accepting people on the whole.
Why the brothers have had this falling out is a mystery,
but what is known is that Hakumon doesn’t hide who he is,
but his brother does. For whatever reason, whether a misunderstanding, a disagreement, or a case of stubborn, wounded
pride, the brothers have gone their separate ways, but maybe
there is a way to mend the fences and bring the two back
together again.
Shoyu Show-Down. Goons from a ramen shop in Yatamon
rudely enter Hakumon’s and demand a showdown right there
and then. Customers move to clear out, but the goons demand
that everyone (especially one or more of the adventurers)
stays to, “Settle once and for all who has the best ramen!”

ROA KALA
DARA VILLAGE

A

ccording to scholars, three hundred years ago, the First Dara emerged from the forest and wandered the world as a
nomad, before his death he founded Roa Kala. Although Roa Kala is a village where newborn dara live for the first year
or so, most dara consider the grove of trees that birth them into the world the “true” Roa Kala. In either case, Roa Kala is
the birthplace for all dara who now follow in the footsteps of the first.
At present, Roa Kala is a village of a hundred or so simple, open-air buildings all built around the central hall. This hall,
known to dara as the Hom-Da, the house of the First Dara, is a solid stone structure where all the dara of Roa Kala congregate
to feast, commune, and share stories together. All the other houses of the dara radiate from the central hall in the pattern of
a giant thumbprint. Each dara house is a simple affair, often housing a single dara, but there are some who choose to become
siblings or parents of each other, and when that happens, they build a house big enough for all involved.

Reputation
Roa Kala is known by most Obojimans who are not dara, as
it’s safe to say that almost any dara traveler that you might
encounter on the road or passing through town is originally
from Roa Kala. Most Obojimans have never been to Roa
Kala but, if asked, they are most likely to believe it is a
magical and mysterious place that is to be respected.

A Dara is Born
When a dara emerges from a tree, it seeks out an “imparting” glyph that appears on the tree from which it was born.
This glyph gives the dara its initial life information it needs
to function in the world. Every imparting glyph gives a dara
the understanding of language and writing, but beyond
that, each imparting glyph is unique and is what makes
every dara their own person.
When a dara touches their imparting glyph, the download
of information is so intense that they sit in a kind of reverie
for up to a week. During this time, they are watched and
cared for by the Kohdoi, a group of dara monks who dedicate some or all of their lives to this sacred duty.

The Glyphless
Although it is rare, some dara do not connect with their
imparting glyph. These dara, also known as the glyphless,
are forced to carve a new path in life, one that is drastically
different from most of their kin. Although they still possess
all the unique attributes of a dara, it’s not uncommon for
them to be fully unaware of how to tap into these powers.
Most glyphless never find their way to Roa Kala, but those
that do are offered an opportunity to reconnect with their
people and uncover their hidden strengths—a process that
can take years to accomplish.

Naming Ceremony
After a dara absorbs their imparting glyph, the Kohdoi
take them to the central hall where they are given their
name. Most dara that start their journey in Roa Kala honor
the First Dara by taking their personal name, followed by
“Dara”. Although dara can have various names, there are
some that are traditional within Roa Kala.

Dawn Blossom Dara
There are only a few dawn blossom trees that grow in the
grove that surrounds Roa Kala, so when a Dara is born from
one, it is considered special or lucky by the villagers— a
thought further realized by the fact that Dara who are born
from dawn blossom trees will often have unique coloration.

Life in Roa Kala
After a dara is named, they serve in Roa Kala for a year or
more, tending to the central hall and spending some time as
one of the Kohdoi. In that initial year, they take a home in
one of the empty homes and begin to learn about life and
the world around them from other dara and from the occasional visitor to Roa Kala.
Although dara are born fully grown and without a family,
they often choose family members by the proximity of the
other trees next to them. A close relative might be “three
trees away” while a close sibling or parent might have come
from the next tree over.
But dara can make anything or anyone into their parent
or sibling. They generally attach to someone by choice and
then ask to be their child or sibling. If a dara feels a connection, they may ask a loving cat if it would be their mom, or
they may ask a friend if they would be their brother
or sister.

Death of a Dara
If a dara becomes aware of their time drawing to a close,
they return to Roa Kala so they can impart their important
knowledge and experiences into a tree with the last expenditure of their life force. Like all dara glyphs, these “departing glyphs” are only visible to a dara.
There are situations where a dara may not be able to get
back to Roa Kala in time. In these cases, a dara will find a
tree and impart their glyph into it. In the case of a sudden
death, the dara’s knowledge and experience is lost forever.
Such a death is deeply mourned if news of the tragedy
returns to Roa Kala.

In the event of a dara player character leaving behind their life’s knowledge in a departing glyph
before they die, but then being resurrected, you
can play this a number of ways. One way is that
when the resurrection spell is cast, their departing glyph vanishes from the tree and they return
to life with all their memories. Another way is
that when they resurrect, they must find another imparting glyph so that they may be “born”
anew. If your player finds this interesting, they
can invent a whole new persona for their resurrected dara adventurer.

NPCs
Audok (male dara). Audok is an elder of the Kohdoi and
a caretaker of Roa Kala. A non-dara would say that Audok
is the head of Roa Kala, but he would not claim such
a title. He’s an incredibly humble and kind individual
who wishes to serve his people and his culture as best
he can. At the ripe old age of 90, he claims he has
another thirty years in him before he plans to step
down from his role.
Myara (female dara). Myara is an artisan known to
craft exquisite and sturdy walking sticks—some of
which become magical over time. She’s become quite
popular over the past few decades, as new dara wish
nothing more than to have a Myara walking stick
for their journey. Though she enjoys the attention,
she won’t make a stick for just anyone—to get an
expertly crafted Myara walking stick, you must
earn her friendship first.
Joshi (male dara). Joshi is a dara who never
connected with an imparting glyph. Rather than leaving
Roa Kala to learn more about the world, he instead chose
to stay and enjoy the comforts the community offers
him. Most of the time he can be found sitting in the
woods around Roa Kala, occasionally painting symbols
or making remarks about the nature of reality. Now
and then, Joshi has a vision—sometimes of things
that have happened or things that might happen.
Though Joshi’s gift is incredible, he struggles to find
the motivation to use it. He’d much prefer to enjoy the beautiful scenery around him than answer questions all day.
Poli (female dara). Poli is a ranger who serves as grove
keeper for Roa Kala, recording any new glyphs she may find
within the forest and protecting glyph trees from howlers,
who have been known to chop them down for firewood.
Though she technically has a home within the village, she
spends most of her time outside of it. The grove of trees
that are considered to be a part of Roa Kala stretch for
miles and so she is constantly on the move, keeping a close
eye on every corner of the forest. Poli is overall well liked
amongst the dara who live in the village, but to outsiders,
she’s been known to be less than friendly, as she’s spent a
lifetime running woodcutters and bandits out of the forest.

Points of Interest
Hom-Da. Hom-Da is the central building where all dara and
visitors to Roa Kala are encouraged to stay and have communion. It’s meant to bring dara together and have them
interact and learn about those who have come before them.
The interior of Hom-Da is a museum and a temple, as well
as a feast hall and guesthouse. The grounds that surround
Hom-Da are filled with beloved ancient trees, each with
its own story and name—beyond that is a stone wall that
surrounds this central area and marks the space as sacred.

AUDOK

Glyph Pillars. Found all around the
village are hexagonal stone pillars left
by past dara of great importance. These
pillars hold glyphs that have been
permanently pressed into the stone
plinth and contain a proverb written
by the dara who made it. These
wise words have helped shape the
culture of the dara over the past
three centuries.

Adventure
Hooks
The Unfinished Quest. A dara,
with its dying breath, imparted a
glyph into a tree that was everything
they knew about an unfinished quest
they were undertaking. This departing
glyph could be in Roa Kala or it could be out in the wilderness of Obojima.
If a dara adventurer chooses to accept the glyph, they
experience a mental whiplash, as they learn all the knowledge about the dara’s unfinished quest.
The Defiler. While the adventurers are in Roa Kala, they
are approached by one of the Kohdoi and are told a tale
of glyphs being carved from trees, rendering the glyphs
useless and in essence, destroying a dara life. Non-dara are
unable to see glyphs, which means
that either there is a dara heretic
destroying glyphs or someone or
thing has taken a dara captive
and is forcing them to point out
glyphs. The Kohdoi ask that this
atrocity be stopped quickly.

THE COASTAL HIGHLANDS
In the south of Obojima, the Coastal Highlands rise majestically from the lush expanse of the Gale Fields and the mistshrouded marshes of the Brackwater Wetlands. The highlands are a rugged plateau of hardy, windblown trees, rolling grasslands and jagged stones that conclude in a breathtaking precipice where the land abruptly meets the sea with a wall of sheer
cliffs. Carved by centuries of wind and waves, these cliffs house extensive networks of caves, their mouths opening directly
over the ocean, inviting daring explorers to plumb their depths.
Venturing to the Coastal Highlands, travelers might find themselves drawn to the serene beauty of the Whispering Forest,
or journey down the Din River to Opal Falls, Obojima’s tallest and most awe-inspiring waterfall whose waters the villagers
have ingeniously harnessed to power everything from a grain mill to elevators and woodworking tools.
There are remnants of the First Age here, one such place is the Broken Bird Airfield. This First Age relic, with its derelict
runway and skeletal aircraft, is home to a peculiar hermit and a host of harrowing harpies—a dangerous yet tantalizing destination for those fascinated by artifacts of the First Age or the mysteries of flight.

capture travelers for a feast, to demand tribute, to invite them to a gambling game, or to mug them for loot.

5

Sudden Fog. A dense, magical fog rolls in, reducing visibility to zero. The fog causes disorientation unless the party can
navigate by sound or other means. If the party is near the cliffs, a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) saving
throw should be made to avoid falling into the sea or being dashed on the rocks below.

6

Wind-Swept Cliff. Sudden and powerful winds blow across the highlands. the adventurers must succeed on a DC 14
Strength saving throw or be pushed 1d4x5 feet in a random direction—hopefully not off a cliff.

OPAL FALLS

I

f you travel within the dense woods of the Whispering Forest or venture up the wild rapids of the Din River, you’ll eventually hear the roaring sound of Obojima’s tallest waterfall—the spectacular Opal Falls. As you draw closer to the falls, you’ll
soon encounter the eponymous town and its colorful people that have built their lives around this majestic and sacred place.

The bustling town of Opal Falls was originally established around Blue Back Lake which sits at the base of the waterfall. In
their desire to harness the power of the cascading water, the village took to the cliffface, creating the now famous buildings
and structures that climb along the waterfall.

A Vertical Industry

Blue Back Lake

Along the side of the falls are a latticework of scaffolding,
walkways, ropes, and ladders that connect all the various
businesses that use the water to power their tools for drilling, turning, grinding, and sanding. Because of the falls and
its ability to power tools, some of the best woodworkers and
gem cutters are here, creating their works of art. Almost all
of the shops that sell the goods and services are located
at the base of the falls, but if one is adventurous enough
to climb up the precarious and sometimes nauseatingly
rickety platforms, a traveller may stumble on the bargain of
a lifetime.

At the bottom of Opal Falls is Blue Back Lake, named for
the abundance of blue back salmon that come here on
their annual migration up the River Din to their spawning grounds far to the north. The salmon come into Blue
Back Lake from the ocean via the Din River, which flows
due south of Opal Falls, and from the Wallawalla River that
leaves Blue Back Lake and runs to the easternmost part of
the Coastal Highlands.

Reputation
Most Obojimans have heard of Opal Falls, especially
merchants and traders, as Opal Falls is a hub of commerce
that links the north and south together. Although Opal Falls
is known to have all kinds of goods and services, they’re
famed for their many uses of the blue back salmon.

Din, the Great
River Spirit
Blue Back Lake is also the legendary domain of the elder
river spirit, Din, who is said to live in a glowing grotto
deep under the falls—an area that is strictly off limits due
to the danger of the turbulent and treacherous waters. It
is said that long ago, Din sacrificed his power by dividing
himself up into thousands of blue back salmon so that all
of Obojima would not go hungry. Because of this, Din is the
weakest of the elder river spirits, but he is also the most
well known and well loved, and for this, he is often called
Din the Provider.

The Great Salmon
Festival
Since Obojimans are known to love a good festival, a yearly
gathering arose to celebrate the salmon and their magical
ascent up the falls. As the salmon gather in Blue Back Lake,
Din’s magic imbues them with power, allowing them to
take off up the rushing white water of the falls in a burst of
supernatural vigor and strength, wriggling and thrashing
until they reach the top of the falls and continue on their
way up the Din River.
Townsfolk come out from their houses, workshops, and
shops, dressed in a variety of blue back salmon costumes
and creatively designed salmon-themed hats, to gather at
the banks of the lake and watch the salmon swim up the
falls. Some mark their champions and bet to see whose
salmon reaches the top of the falls first. Others hold a “King
and Queen of the Salmon” ball where singing, dancing, and
feasting are all a part of the celebration.

certain tiny companion spirits who love to make their home
within one of Warwick’s glittering creations.
Liffi Bolo (female human). Liffi is one of the village elders
who puts on a glittering salmon suit and leads the great
salmon festival every year. She is a kindly woman and is
one of the few villagers that have seen Din the great river
spirit. This moment has forever changed her and since then
she has been devoted to the village and its traditions.
Mazuka Bo (male human). Mazuka is a reclusive druid
who lives at the base of the river, talking to the salmon,
both real and imaginary. Almost all the villagers in Opal
Falls know of him and think he’s a bit looney, but most find
him to be harmless and amusing. He lives inside an artifact
from the First Age called an Airstream that he has made to
look like a salmon. He’s used boom beri to paint the exterior
and added on wood and cloth fins that he has dyed using
beetles and lichen. The floor of his Airstream is filled with
water and the occasional salmon, as he’s carved a channel
from the river into his home.
Din, the Spirit of Opal Falls (elder spirit). Din is one of
the four great river spirits of Obojima and is one of the few
elder spirits that so freely shares his domain with others,
though Din rarely reveals himself to the villagers of Opal
Falls. Din instead spends most of his time communing with
the blue backed salmon. While underwater, Din often stays
in the form of a giant blue back salmon, only changing into
his humanoid form when speaking with physical beings.
Although Din doesn’t often intervene in the affairs of the
physical world, he does sometimes step in to aid it, as he
is known to grant dying villagers a second life as a salmon.
At the moment, Din is distraught, as word of the Lionfish
King’s raids has traveled to his ear.
Din believes the Lionfish King
is better than this and
should right his path.

River Master’s Tower, a stout wooden building surrounded
by a large dock where the River Master, Wayla (female
elf), oversees the boat traffic coming up and down the
river and collects the toll for portage up and down the
falls. Before any boats can get to the falls from the north,
they must first get past the gate that spans the river. Any
boats coming up the falls from the south get hauled up the
river, past the gate to safety by a series of ropes and pulleys
powered by the rushing water.

Temple Under the Falls. At the bottom of the falls, deep
under the turbulent and dangerous water, is the lair of the
great river spirit, Din. Getting into this temple-like structure is perilous at best, and many have died trying to find
Din’s lair. Mazuka Bo is perhaps the only one alive who
knows the secret to getting into Din’s temple, but he would
never make the journey unless directed by Din himself or
one of his noble salmon. The secret that Mazuka knows is
that you either have to hold on to the back of a salmon and
command it to take you into Din’s lair, or you must turn
into a salmon yourself.
Troop #503 Secret Headquarters. Troop #503 are a group
of Young Stewards that are particularly interested in getting
up to all kinds of adventure in and around Opal Falls. They
are a tight-knit bunch who know quite a bit about the
Coastal Highlands and the creatures inside it. They have
their own secret HQ, a place that only they know, less
than a mile from the town called the Crumbled Hut—a First
Age house where Troop #503 hangs out and plots their
next adventure.

YOUNG STEWARDS
TROOP #503

Wayla is in charge of two gangs of dockworkers who run
water-powered elevators driven by giant wooden gears and
pulleys on the western side of the falls—one that brings
boats up and the other to lower boats down. Wayla is also
on the lookout for errant boats so they don’t slip over the
falls, and just in case, there is a strong rope net that goes
across the 100-foot span at the top to catch any wayward
vessels that break free from their moorings.
Wayla is also a member of the Courier Brigade and
proudly tells everyone who is interested that the very first
postal box was established here and was made in honor of
the great river spirit, Din. That’s why every postal box is
designed to look like some kind of fish or fish’s mouth.
Old Stonetail Tavern. This tavern is filled with wreckage
collected from boats and broken crafts—like harpoons,
oars, sails, and swords—that were from encounters on
the river with Old Stonetail, a giant crocodile known for
its petrified tail that it uses to smash and sink anything
that floats into its territory. Former barge pilot turned
bartender, Eliza Grumm (female human), always has
a tale or two of near misses and loves to enchant her
patrons with firsthand accounts of the monster’s enormous size and prodigious strength. Although there are
some in the town who think the tavern is in bad taste,
the locals who frequent the tavern tend to speak of the
monster with a tone of respect and even reverence.

Adventure Hooks
Fight on the Falls. As a boat is being hauled up to the top
of the falls, a fight breaks out amongst the crew on the boat.
As mayhem ensues, one of the hauling ropes snaps and the
boat begins to swing sickeningly across the cliff face and the
falls with people clinging for dear life.
The Running Portal. The adventurers are approached
by troop #503 of Young Stewards who worriedly say that
their scout leader is missing. They say that their scoutmaster went through a wandering door that was standing in
the middle of the forest and vanished. When they went to
follow him, the door frame ran off on two legs.

BROKEN BIRD AIRFIELD

B

roken Bird Airfield is a First Age site that features the remnants of an airstrip, with a cluster of hangars at one end, and
a modest air traffic control tower at the other. Prickly shrubs push their way through the cracks in an uneven runway
that is flanked by the husks of ancient airplanes, some of which look as if they were torn to pieces by enormous talons.
Patches of red-orange lichen give everything a mottled appearance.
Broken Bird Airfield is a notorious place where a crazy old hermit obsesses over old airplanes and where hard drinking,
foul-mouthed, flesh-devouring harpies who play cards have made it their lair. It’s a place of a thousand dangers that time and
reputation have helped to develop over the years. But it also has certain allure for those who marvel at anything related to the
First Age, particularly anything to do with airplanes.
Among the young stewards, the dangers associated with Broken Bird Airfield make it irresistible to those who want to
prove their bravery or who are compelled to visit on account of the immutable law of the dare. Sneaking onto the airfield and
returning with a trinket has become a rite of passage for the local chapter of the Young Stewards.

Flying Phin’s
Airship Service
Broken Bird Airfield is home to Flying Phin’s Airship Service,
a mechanic-for-hire who specializes in flying machines.
Business is slow, even with the recent spike in interest
surrounding flight in Sky Kite Valley far to the north. That’s
fine by Phin, who would rather spend his days tinkering
with one of the many grounded planes gathered in the

hangars in different states of repair. However, if the price is
right, he’ll set aside his own work and take on a commission.

weight. Neither Phin nor the harpies are aware of just how
big the colony is.

Phin is one of the best in his field that Obojima has to
offer, even though his machines can only stay aloft for
limited durations, and that’s if the airship can even get off
the ground at all. When one sputters out on the runway, it’s
often to a chorus of cackling harpies looking on from the air
traffic control tower.

Giant Slumbering Cat. A short distance from the runway
is a large, circular mound of earth known as Rumble Hill.
Anyone approaching Rumble Hill might hear and feel the
low reverberation for which it is named. At first glance,
the hill appears to be covered in soft, downy orange grass,
making it the ideal place to watch one of Phin’s contraptions struggling to get airborne. However, unbeknownst to
the people of the airfield, the hill is actually a curled-up,
sleeping cat of prodigious size. Only the loudest noises
will cause it to stir, and once awakened, it’ll fixate on movement. A flying machine barreling down the runway is sure
to be the most enticing plaything.

Harpy Riff Raff
Several years ago, a gang of harpies took the airfield’s
air traffic control tower and made it their aerie. There are
twelve harpies in all, and they dress as pilots, with flight
jackets, scarves, and goggles. When they’re not out tormenting travelers on nearby roads, they spend their nights in
rowdy revelry, smoking, telling bawdy jokes, and gambling
over a game of cards known as “rusty spades”. Most mornings, they’ve drunk themselves into a collective stupor,
which lasts until dusk, when it all begins again.
These crass ladies enjoy encouraging their rare guests to
indulge in their bad habits. If they haven’t devoured a guest,
it doesn’t mean they won’t, and it is therefore wise to never
feel too comfortable around them.
They can flip from bitingly playful to just biting in
a matter of seconds, especially if the creature is their
preferred snack. In these cases, they become physically
more monstrous. They become hunched. Their claws and
teeth lengthen, while their eyes gleam with malice.
For all their voracious hunger, the harpies won’t eat Phin,
who unsettles them with his pungent, vinegary odor. They
will however snatch his tools from time to time and mock
him when his flying machines fail to take off.

Monster Territory
The hubbub at the airfield can attract the attention of one
of the gigantic or strange creatures found nearby.
The Hunter. The Hunter is one of the three great beasts
that dwell on Obojima. It is an enormous bird of prey thats
constantly circling the island in search of the giant fish
that it dives for and takes into the sky. Many villagers have
their own myths about the Hunter, its purpose, and where
its nest could potentially be, but to this day, the Hunter is
mostly shrouded in mystery.
Slime Colony. An enormous colony of green slimes
dwells beneath the cracked and pothole riddled runway.
The colony is dormant, though the occasional slime will
awaken, drawn to the surface by an appetite for machines.
If something heavy trundles down the runway, the slimes
might emerge like a flood. They are dangerous in such great
numbers, and even more so for flying machines, as they’ll
latch onto it, potentially adding a substantial amount of

The cat was not always as big as a hill. In fact, it was once
just a normal house cat named Lyle who belonged to a little
girl in Opal Falls many years ago. But by random chance, he
continued to grow in size, eventually becoming the giant
creature he is today. And the larger he grew, the more he
napped. This is how he became mistaken for a hill in recent
years. The little girl in Opal Fall is now quite old, but she
still remembers Lyle and leaves a saucer of milk for him
every day on her porch.

NPCs
Phin (male human). The old man has lived at the airfield
longer than anyone, including the harpies, which he refers
to as “those dumb birds who are always stealing my tools.”
He makes his home in a corner of one of the hangars,
which allows him to leap out of bed in the middle of the
night when inspiration strikes to work
on his obsession—the restoration of a
First Age aircraft he lovingly calls “the
Menace.” Phin first encountered the
ancient machine in his youth, when he
was a member of AHA, and he has
devoted his life to getting the
old thing flying again. His
disheveled appearance
perfectly complements
the chaotic state of his
workshop. He is able to
continue pursuing his quest
by taking the occasional
job to cobble together a flying
machine for a
paying customer.
The harpies won’t eat Phin.
He discovered that they despise
vinegar, a fact he exploits with
a steady diet of pickles and a
daily bath in pickle brine.
PHIN

102

Gouger, Cutya, and Strafe (harpies). The self-proclaimed
captain of the harpies, Gouger, can be a bit of a bully. She is
quiet and cunning, always even keeled and known for her
deadpan sense of humor. She can probably drink any of the
other harpies under the table and is always happy to test
that. Gouger’s two lieutenants are Cutya and Strafe. Cutya
is bloodthirsty and cruel, with a penchant for Nakudama
flesh, which, according to her, is “oh so succulent.” Meanwhile, Strafe comes across as the most approachable of the
harpies, but this is what makes her dangerous. She can lull
people into a false sense of security until her appetite gets
the better of her.
Bomber (harpy). This hulking harpy has clipped wings
that have left her unable to fly. She is fascinated by aircrafts
and spends much of her time in the cockpits of the derelict aircrafts that are scattered around the airfield. Though
she would like to learn from Phin, she hasn’t been able to
bring herself to ask, especially because she knows the other
harpies would frown upon this relationship.
Plitsu (spirit). This adorable little spectral spirit is the
reason for Phin’s repeated failure to keep the Menace
airworthy. For whatever reason, Plitsu believes that this
piece of First Age technology needs to remain grounded,
and it is by the spirit’s efforts that Phin has so far only had
minimal success, as it is Plitsu, and not the harpies, who
has been stealing tools.
Plitsu will use its cuteness to win over the adventurers
and paint Phin as a villain. However, if anyone follows the
spirit to its dwelling in a nearby copse of trees they will find
the cache of stolen tools.

Points of Interest

The second hangar is a nest of old airplane parts, the
order of which is known only to Phin. This is a great spot
for adventurers to try out their salvage skill. For more on
the salvage skill, see page 165.
Behind the hangars is a small garden where Phin grows
cucumbers that he uses to make pickles.

Adventure Hooks
Escape the Harpies. The adventurers are captured by
harpies and brought to the air traffic control tower. The
harpies want to play with their food before devouring them,
however, a night of gambling might just give the adventurers a chance to escape…if they play their cards right.
Alternatively, the adventurers are enlisted to rescue a
group of young stewards who snuck onto the airfield as part
of a dare. They never returned and are believed to be in the
harpies’ clutches.
Secure a Flying Machine. If the adventurers are in need
of a flying machine, they get word that Phin is taking
commissions. Once there, they must help him figure out
why his tools keep going missing. If they solve that, they
must successfully achieve takeoff, even as their efforts
attract the attention of one or more nearby monsters.
New Wings. The adventurers are approached by Bomber,
the harpy with clipped wings. She has a piece of valuable
information that she’s willing to trade if the adventurers
can help her fly again. She’s desperate.
GOUGER, CUTYA,
& STRAFE

Air Traffic Control Tower. The harpies make their lair in
the abandoned air traffic control tower that looks out over
the runway. The tower is approximately 50 feet tall, with
a boxy control room perched at the top of a narrow metal
frame, around which climbs the remnants of a broken ladder.
The interior of the control room is usually dimly lit with
a few lamps. Empty bottles and small bones lay in scattered
heaps, and the air is thick with cigar smoke. The central
feature is a scuffed card table, where the harpies gather
to gamble, drink, and share bawdy jokes. Their raucous
laughter carries across the airfield nightly. There’s a bank
of busted up control panels against one of the walls, and a
nearby cabinet contains old airplane plans that Phin would
love to get his hands on.
Hangars. The airfield has a pair of modest hangars, one of
which contains the Menace in all its half-built glory. Phin
lives in this hangar in a ramshackle loft built from scaffolding. All kinds of tools can be found here (except for the
ones stolen by the tiny spirit Plitsu). Anyone looking for
Phin is likely to find him here if he’s not actively testing
one of his aircrafts.

AHA HEADQUARTERS

he guild of Archeologists, Historians, and Archivists, or AHA, makes its headquarters in an old observatory perched on
a promontory that overlooks the sea on the southeastern corner of the island. Those seeking knowledge about Obojima’s
history or its myriad mysteries would do well to travel to this remote site.

Folks who approach the observatory by land find what appears to be a modest, circular domed structure that could easily be
mistaken for a small hermit’s hovel. From the ocean, one can appreciate the observatory’s grandeur, which rises from the sea
like a great pillar clinging to the cliffside. The observatory boasts more than a dozen levels, and several chambers extend from
the confines of the cylindrical structure into the cliff itself.
The AHA facility is part observatory, part museum, part library, and part laboratory. The archeologists maintain several
floors of laboratory space, while the historians curate a vast assortment of curios from all over the island. The archivists keep
their archive here, which is the largest collection of written works, cassettes, and videos on the island. Together, the members
of AHA have collaborated to piece together the timeline of Obojima’s history. They have deciphered much of the language of
the First Age and unraveled mysteries of the technology from that long bygone era.

Tone/Vibe
Cluttered, busy, museum-like, academic

Experts in Residence
Much of AHA’s activity happens in the field, on one of
the many expeditions and research sites happening at any
given time, but there are always at least a handful of guild

104

members who remain at the headquarters to process new
information, maintain the collections housed here, and
continue research that can only be done by consulting texts
or conducting lab experiments. The experts-in-residence,
as they are known, are also expected to make themselves
available to visitors who come with inquiries on matters
about which AHA is interested, though a small fee may be
requested for such services.

The Headquarters
The headquarters boasts nineteen levels, starting with the
observatory facility at the pinnacle and ending with the
underwater observation deck, which is now flooded. The
guild’s governing body—the Asloh—has a council chamber
where they hear reports from the field and coordinate new
research efforts and expeditions. There is a level dedicated
to housing guests, as well as cafeteria level.

The Corruption. Many studies and experiments have been
put on hold in favor of researching the Corruption. At the
moment, several rangers, who’d been among the first to
respond to the Corruption’s appearance, now live in one of
the laboratory units under constant care and observation.
Though researchers have yet to find a cure or even a way to
slow the spread of the Corruption, they have made extensive notes about its effects.

Chronicler Spirits. A dozen or so robed chronicler spirits
drift through the HQ, available to take dictation from guild
members. When chronicling, long, narrow strips of scroll
unfurl from the sleeves of their robes, bearing the script of
what was dictated to them. The archive contains spools of
such dictations.

The Disappearing Mountain. Years ago, a mountain
suddenly emerged on the horizon to the northeast of the
island. It then traveled southward for two days until it
disappeared again. It was never seen again. An expedition set out on a boat to find the mountain, but they never
returned. This is an older mystery, but it remains an obsession of a small group of guild members.

The Telescope

NPCs

The AHA HQ is quite proud of its telescope, which has only
recently been refurbished and conscripted back into service
to observe the night sky and track the movements of Obojima’s many large flying beasts. It can monitor the peak of
Mount Arbora, and has even been used to gaze down to the
Corrupted coastline.

Delving into Mysteries
AHA headquarters is home to seemingly countless ongoing
studies, many of which are far from conclusive and only
serve to add to the pile of questions in need of answering.
Here are a few baffling discoveries that AHA members have
yet to explain.
Something is Up with the Stars. AHA observers have
been watching the stars through the observatory’s telescope
for some time now and they have noticed a remarkable shift
in the movement of the constellations. Ancient scrolls,
that some say are from the time of the First Age, show star
constellations and planets that are not recognizable or are
no longer visible, and there are other charts from more
recent ages that hint at long cycles of star patterns with
decades of apparent stellar chaos. But the most recent
measurements now show that the motions of the heavens
have slowed considerably, and are no longer these lengthy
cycles but are now short and strangely predictable.
There is much discussion and debate within the observatory. Some AHA observers believe that the current data
reveals that the stars are slowing down, which to them is a
sign of an age of order, prosperity, and that the sky spirits
are becoming calm and less agitated. But other observers
believe that the island may have previously been adrift, like
a leaf on a pond, and has somehow come to a stop, causing
the stars to slow as well. Until the truth is uncovered (see
the Mysteries section) AHA observers will continue their
observations, theories, and will welcome any information
adventurers can bring.

Uba, Chief Archivist (male dara). While the other two
members of the governing Asloh prefer to operate in the
field, the chief archivist prefers to personally oversee day-today operations of the archive. He regards it as his baby, and
he fastidiously dotes on it with great care. He is not miserly
about the collection of books, theses, and records, and he is
happy to share with anyone who demonstrates genuine interest in the topics found here. His manner is that of a teacher
who believes everyone is capable of contributing worthy
ideas, and it is his mission to capture them all. He carries
with him a great shame, as he once allowed a charlatan
scholar to abscond with a treasured tome of lore that detailed
a network of caves in Mount Arbora.
Lonzo, Telescope Operator (male human). Grizzled,
grumbly, and with a voice like gravel, the telescope operator
is the oldest member of AHA. Lonzo spends much of time
alone with the telescope, nodding off occasionally as he
charts the stars. A First Age radio he keeps with him emits
a din of white noise, interrupted from time to time with
mysterious snippets in a garbled language Lonzo claims are
“dispatches about some war.”
Chloe, Archeologist (female elf). Chloe is a wizard who
joined AHA to pursue a lifelong obsession with anything
related to technology from the First Age. She is often found in
her workshop among an array of partially assembled devices,
scattered tools, and half a dozen companion spirits who help
her with her work. Chloe’s specialty is cassette players and is
an avid collector of First Age music—the louder the better.
Vutochi, Corruption Researcher (spirit). Perhaps the
foremost expert on the Corruption and its effects on living
creatures is a cat spirit known as Vutochi. AHA has therefore been placed in charge of the guild’s research into the
strange phenomenon. Vutochi has a dispassionate air, and
during conversations, the spirit is known to appear disengaged or even go into a kind of trance. What folks don’t
know is that Vutochi exists in both the Physical Realm and
Spirit Realm at the same time, and at times, the scientist
must shift its attention from one plane to the other.

105

Points of Interest
Observation Dome and Foyer. The entrance to AHA
headquarters opens onto the top floor, where the guild’s
prized telescope is set up. When the telescope is retracted,
it dominates the space, encroaching on the collection of
overstuffed chairs meant for guests awaiting an audience
with the guild. The telescope’s handler, Lonzo, can often be
heard snoring from his perch by the telescope.
The Archive. The majority of the six floors occupied by
the Archive is dedicated to storing the vast collection of
documents in floor-to-ceiling shelves that line the cylindrical inner wall, accessible by one of the many attached
ladders. Within these shelves, at irregular intervals, are
cubbies that serve as bunks for the archivists. In all, there is
enough room for thirty archivists to sleep this way within
the archive. A vault, which contains the most precious
documents, is in a secure chamber within the cliffside.
The Archive has several study rooms, as well as specialized
rooms that are lined with cork boards and supplied with
spools of string. These “theory closets” can be checked out
for a period of time, allowing guild members to immerse
themselves in the exploration of an idea. There’s also a
theater room, where archivists can examine the contents of
the many VHS tapes in their possession.

Curio Rooms. Collectively, the curio rooms are akin to an
AHA museum, displaying all sorts of odds and ends from
throughout the island’s history. One of the rooms houses one
of AHA’s greatest treasures—a collection of First Age arcade
games known as the Detective Werewolf Saga. All eight
installments are in working order and on display. One of the
more dramatic displays is an entire disassembled motorcycle
suspended from the ceiling, which looks like a 3D exploded
view diagram of the vehicle.
Laboratories. Near the bottom of the headquarters are the
laboratories. Many of these have been repurposed over the
past several months to accommodate research being done
on the Corruption. One floor has been turned into a living
quarters for four rangers suffering the Corruption’s ill effects.
AHA researchers monitor them constantly for any signs
of change. Other lab rooms contain aquariums that each
contain fish that have skeletonized due to contact with the
Corruption. These labs are closely guarded due to the volatile
nature of the research and the potentially disastrous consequences should material affected by the Corruption get loose.
Flooded Observation Deck. The lowest levels of AHA
headquarters have actually been forgotten. They once
served as an underwater observation deck, but they flooded
long ago, and were sealed off. Unbeknownst to AHA, these
chambers have recently been discovered and occupied by
corrupted viperfish folk, loyal to Venomous Rex, who have
been looking for a way into the HQ.

Adventure Hooks
All of AHA’s research efforts are coordinated and supplied
from the headquarters. Here’s a list of some of their current
operations on the island. The adventurers could be asked to
join, escort, or check in on any of them.
◊ Tidewater—to study the phenomenon of objects washing up on the shore near the small seaside town (see page
36 for more information).
◊ Shoom—an initial expedition to this abandoned
Nakudama Age site (see page 33 for more information).
◊ Coaster Divers’ Lodge, Southern Branch—to catalog
and study First Age objects pulled from the seafloor (see
page 24 for more information).

RESEARCHER

THE SHALLOWS
Encircling the mystical island of Obojima, the Shallows are a sprawling undersea expanse, where the sandy seabed extends for
miles beneath the crystal-clear waters in a ring around the island. Here, coral formations weave an intricate maze that is both
a sanctuary and battlefield, home to a multitude of sea monsters, spirits, and marine life. There are wrecks from long-forgotten
eras, sunken buildings from the First Age, and treasures that lie hidden in coral caves guarded by spirits or beasts.
The Shallows are ruled by two formidable rivals: the Lionfish King, adorned with his crown of feathery, toxic spines and
Venomous Rex, a viperfish whose ghastly visage and dagger-like teeth command fear and respect. These two larger-than-life
characters have left each other to their own devices for several decades, but have grown increasingly hostile since the arrival
of the Corruption.

Wandering Encounters
Roll
d12

Wandering Encounter

1

Fish Folk Pirates. A band of 1d4+4 fishfolk pirates aboard their ship, the Snapping Turtle, which is made from a giant
turtle shell. They demand a toll for passing through their territory. They may offer a parley, willing to trade for something
of value. They can also be bribed or tricked.

2

Ghost Ship. A boat from the First Age can be seen floating in the Shallows. It could be piloted by a spirit that has
whelmed its engine or it could be mysteriously abandoned with a series of strange clues on board that point to a
sunken city.

3

Sunken Treasure. At the bottom of the Shallows, barely visible through a hole in the hull of a sunken wooden ship, an
iron-bound chest can be seen, lying half-buried in the sand. The wreck is in 20 feet of water and is guarded by a seaweed
elemental. The chest could contain a famous lost treasure or clues to another adventure on land.

4

Spirit Serpent. This animalistic spirit serpent could serve as a sage or a foe, providing information or demanding tribute
for safe passage.

5

Whirlpool. Avoiding the whirlpool requires quick thinking and agility. Getting caught in it requires strength and stamina.
Those who survive might discover a hidden treasure or sunken city.

6

Trickery in the Seas. The party encounters a deep angler that is looking for an unsuspecting meal.

7

Sleeping Girl. At the bottom of the Shallows is a little girl no older than 5 who is sleeping in an air bubble.

8

Lady Blue. A spirit that takes the visage of an enormous red-headed women is drawn by the presence of the party. They
might be curious, indifferent, or hostile, depending on their actions.

9

Tendrils of Corruption. Dark tendrils of the Corruption bubble up from the reef causing a twisted maze of web-like
strands. Navigating through the Corruption takes several skill checks. Note: This encounter should happen only on the
eastern half of the Shallows.

10

The Doomspine. The party sees the Doomspine (see below) and on board is the Lionfish King along with 3d4 of his most
loyal pirates.

11

Shark! The party’s activities in the Shallows draws the attention of a giant shark*.

12

School of Fish. A school of skeletal fish swims toward the party. Perhaps one of them is a companion spirit that takes a
liking to a party member and has some interesting information to share.

O

DOMAIN OF THE
LIONFISH KING

ne of the more colorful and villainous creatures in the world of Obojima is the Lionfish King, a self-proclaimed
monarch and a pompous, moody, and vain creature who rules over the fish folk of the Western Shallows with his band
of pirates and barracuda warriors. He has declared that his rightful domain is the entire length and breadth of the Shallows—the miles-wide reef that circles Obojima—and his pirates patrol the waters to enforce his authority. Everything within
the Shallows, from sunken shipwrecks, small island grottoes, lost treasures, and submerged buildings (many from the First
Age) are all part of his kingdom by royal decree.

Tone/Vibe
Otherworldly, Odd, Excessive, Over The Top

Reputation
The Lionfish King, and fish folk in general, are well known
throughout the coastal towns and villages all across the
shores of Obojima. Most humans and land-dwellers who
fish the Shallows are often plagued by fish folk pirates and
are forced to pay tribute to the Lionfish King as part and
parcel for fishing in the Western Shallows. Most fisherfolk
begrudgingly pay tribute but there are some who resent it
and wouldn’t mind seeing the fish folk or the Lionfish King
himself get a sound thrashing. Because of this, most relations are tense between land dwellers and fish folk, but there
are some areas where fish folk and land-dwellers live in relative harmony, but those places are few and far between.

109

The Coral Castle

Royal Aspirations

The Lionfish King’s central palace is a hill-sized mound of
coral, which is covered in a variety of sea vegetation. The
Coral Castle’s main gate is underwater and is flanked by
poisonous anemones big enough to easily snare and devour
a person whole. The underwater grounds are also patrolled
by heavily armored and thuggish crab guardians that can
restrain an unsuspecting intruder so they may be made to
kneel before the Lionfish King or simply crushed into pulp
in their massive claws.

When not actively repelling the encroachment of Venomous Rex and his deepsea lackeys, the Lionfish King is
obsessed with the desire to confirm his nobility by marrying the heir to a royal bloodline. This obsession stems
from two ancient tomes that his pirates stole while looting
several lost Nakudama temples. The two tomes, called the
Royal Lineages, track the royal Nakudama bloodline for the
last several centuries. The only problem for the Lionfish
King is that they were written in a cryptic Nakudama code
that is yet to be fully deciphered. The Lionfish King has his
moray eel wizard working non-stop to crack the code while
his pirates scour the land to find any Nakudama who looks
like she could be of royal bearing.

The upper half of the Coral Castle is hollow and houses
the Lionfish King and the members of his royal court.
These members include his frogfish advisors, his barracuda
warriors, and an assortment of nobles and courtiers of various kinds from butterfly fish to puffers to moray eels.

The Doomspine
While the Lionfish King is in the castle, the Lionfish Royal
Flag is flown from the top of the central keep. When he is
not in the castle, he is on his war barge, the Doomspine, a
ship cobbled together from parts of salvaged wrecks and
other vessels that the Lionfish King has taken while raiding,
the most notable of which is the front half of Captain Clintock’s prototype submarine, the Pointue, which is now the
prow of the Doomspine.

State of the Kingdom

Keep Fish Folk Monstrous!
Like the Kuo-toa of D&D, fish folk were created to
be comical villains and multi-purpose monsters.
If you wish to have a more combat-heavy session,
you can set up the fish folk as malevolent menaces
and dangerous raiders that need to be slain.
If you want a more roleplay heavy adventure,
you can explore a courtly drama of pompous and
scheming fish folk where it’s about intrigue,
power struggles, and solving the problem
of the Corruption.

The Lionfish Kingdom is in a bit of a kerfuffle at the
moment, schools of fish folk are encroaching on his kingdom from the east, fleeing what they are calling “the foul
waters” where the Corruption is polluting the ocean and the
shores. Deep sea fish folk raiders are also moving farther
west, fighting and looting as they go, all of which is making
the Lionfish King more territorial and aggressive.
Despite the Lionfish King’s distrust and attacks on the
shore-dwellers, there are some of his vassals who are secretly
friendly to Obojimans, especially Captain Clintock and his
daughters, Holly and Paloma. These fishfolk know that the
Corruption is a threat to all, and despite their distrust, they
are open to working with land-dwellers to try and find out
how to deal with this danger. But they must not be found out
by their king or his loyalists lest their fins
be hung from the rigging of the Doomspine
and dried in the noonday sun.

THE DOOMSPINE

NPCs

Points of Interest

The Lionfish King (fish folk). The Lionfish King is egotistical, moody, and dangerous, but not a psychopath. He can
be reasoned with as long as it is skewed heavily in his favor.
While he is intimidating and aggressive he is also fearful
of the Corruption that draws ever closer to his reef—he
has seen its power to reduce great sea beasts to skeletons
as well as what it is doing to the deep sea fish folk—so he
is eager to hear about any attempts to find a cure to the
Corruption. It, perhaps, is the only thing that can shake
him out of his narcissistic mania.

Bandit Caves. These coastal locations are hidden sea caves,
lagoons, grottes, and natural caverns in the cliffs. Each of
these caves is a permanent dwelling for fishfolk bandits.
These caves, which are dotted all along the coast, are where
fishfolk pirates take their captives and keep much of their
stolen treasure. Through these secret locations, fishfolk can
emerge to strike any part of the island.

While he may have moments of affability and cooperativeness, the Lionfish King rules primarily by bullying and
guile and has no qualms about going back on his word.

Infiltrate the Doomspine. In the nose cone of Captain
Clintock’s prototype submarine (that is now the prow of
the Doomspine) is a small magic device called an aquatic
stabilizer. The aquatic stabilizer is a magic gyroscope and
underwater navigation device that was created by Captain
Clintock’s late wife, Kara. Since Kara’s death many years
ago, the Mariners’ Guild has failed to recreate the aquatic
stabilizer to the level of the original. For years, Holly Clintock has talked about sneaking on board to steal the device,
but her father has banned the mission several times.

His ultimate goal is to defeat his enemies and control all
of the Shallows, where tribute befitting his royal magnificence will be showered upon him by all who use his
waterways. His crowning glory will be to attain true royal
status by marrying a direct descendant of the Nakudama
queen, Okumi. Then, and only then, will the Lionfish King
be happy.
Venomous Rex (fish folk). The ruler of the deep
sea fish folk is a viperfish known as Venomous Rex. Venomous is suffering from the rot
of the Corruption which has caused him to
become unstable and aggressive. His addled
mind is filled with wild visions of becoming an emperor as well as plunging him into
fits of paranoia where he believes everyone is conspiring against him. Although
Venomous Rex is a psychopath, he isn’t
a fool, and if there is a way to cure
the Corruption, he will listen, but
attempting to strike a deal with
Venomous is a dangerous and
often deadly game.
Sleethar (fish folk). Sleethar
is the Lionfish King’s royal
consigliere and ocean mage who
fears his lord and is under constant
pressure from his demanding monarch and
is desperate to crack the Nakudama tomes.
Sleethar is cowardly by nature, but he is
shrewd and cunning. He knows how to
placate and manipulate his liege, but one
slip and his head will join a host of others
who have toyed a little too carelessly with the
Lionfish King.

Adventure Hooks

Crimson Octopus. In caves at the base of the Coral Castle,
there is a cave that is occupied by a crimson octopus that is
under heavy guard by the Lionfish King’s elite crab sentinels. This octopus, which the king calls Boombox, is the
King’s pride and joy, as he knows how valuable it is—especially to the land dwellers who prize its remarkable ink—
and he is always certain to brag about Boombox to anyone
who will listen in hopes that they will be immensely
impressed. That impressive tale has now made its way to a
collection of witches who desire nothing more than to see,
at the very least, a jar of the crimson octopus ink return
to them, possibly even the creature if a group of
crafty individuals would be willing to take on
the job.
Retrieve the Royal Lineages. The two
Nakudama tomes, the Royal Lineages, are
believed to be lost to time and maybe only
a few people actually know where they
are. If it were to be discovered that they
exist, any Nakudama sage, historian,
or priest would be eternally grateful to
get their webbed fingers back on these
priceless relics. Any Nakudama worth their
salt would volunteer in a heartbeat to join
a quest to get back this sacred part
of their history.

WANDERING LINE

aybe, if you’re lucky enough, as you walk through a field or in a forest, you’ll feel a different kind of breeze blow as a
set of train tracks magically assembles itself in a rush of wood, stones, and steel. Within a few minutes, a train stop
comes together in a clatter of planks, walls, and window panes. A minute or so later, spirits begin to gather, checking
their tickets or idly reading a paper on a bench.
Then, the Wandering Line emerges from the invisible, gliding along its tracks and coming to a stop. A conductor hops out of
the train and with a measure of patience and insistence, gets everyone on board right as the doors close. The train then pulls
away from the depot and vanishes into the Spirit Realm, leaving behind only the breeze and two steel rails that are already
beginning to fade.

Tone/Vibe
Fun, Adventurous, Whimsical, Special

Reputation
Although most Obojimans know of the Wandering Line,
little is known about it. No map of all its stops has ever
been found. No one knows who built it. Obojimans simply
know that it exists and for most, that is enough, but there
are some who for one reason or another, know where and
when the next Wandering Line will appear.

What is the
Wandering Line?
What is certain about the Wandering Line is that it came
with the First Age, a fact that its shape and manufacture
clearly show. But as to why it wound up being in the Spirit
Realm, only one legend has emerged: in the most ancient
of days, the Wandering Line was whelmed by an elder
spirit who fused its power and essence into the form and
fabric of the train and everything connected to it—signs,
depots, benches, and rails—transforming it all into a
single, spirit entity.

113

Facts About the
Wandering Line
Although the Wandering Line is mysterious and magical,
there are some facts:
Wandering Line = Spirit Realm. When an adventurer
enters the Wandering Line they are entering the Spirit Realm.
In this way, the Wandering Line is a portal to the Spirit Realm.
Train Stops. Each train stop has a “stop code”—a sequence
of a symbol and three numbers—that appears on a sign
outside the depot. Once you reach your stop, the conductor comes to make sure you exit safely. If someone tries to
resist, the train vanishes and they unceremoniously fall to
the ground.
Demons. Demons are barred from entering the Wandering
Line unless the train is being used as passage for a demon
being escorted out of the Spirit Realm.
Train Cars. The Wandering Line has only three cars: the
front car, the middle car, and the caboose where the spirit
coal is stored. While all the cars of the Wandering Line can
be climbed on, the train can only be boarded via the doors
on the front car and only if the Conductor allows entry.
◊ The Front Car. The front car is where the conductor
(see “Conductor” below) sits, behind him are some seats
for passengers, and at the end of the car is a set of doors
covering a vestibule that leads to the second car.
◊ The Second Car. The second car is where most of the
passengers sit. This car can be as big or as little as you’d
like it to be. At the far end is another set of doors with a
vestibule in between them leading to the caboose.
◊ The Caboose. The caboose (sometimes called the coal
car) is the final car that is inhabited by the mysterious spirit known as the Coal Master (see “Coal Master”
below). The caboose is locked (lock Pick DC 25) to all creatures who do not work on the train.

Arrival of the Train
Five minutes before the arrival of the Wandering Line,
the tracks and the train depot appear. Each train depot is
unique in its design and size—some being no more than a
small shelter and a sign—but if one is paying attention, a
train depot always seems to be able to comfortably accommodate whoever wishes to board.
A Wandering Line stop is always in an unoccupied space.
Even in the middle of a forest or a town, or on a hillside,
there’s always just enough room for it to come and go. If
people build where the train came last year, it magically
finds a new place when it arrives the next time. In some
cases, when an area is seemingly impossible to get to, the
Wandering Line may “overlay” the Physical Realm for a
temporary time or simply pass through it. The Wandering
Line and the conductor are never late and no obstacle can
get in their way.

114

Getting on the Train
There are many ways to get on the Wandering Line. A ticket
certainly does the trick, but you can also offer all kinds of
things in lieu of one.
Once on the train, a floating basket hovers down the
aisle, and depending on what you put in it is how many
stops you get. As the GM, it’s your call as to what the train
thinks of what an adventurer offers it.
If no fare is offered or no ticket is shown, then you can
choose whether the Wandering Line allows the adventurer
to stay on board or get left behind—the Wandering Line can
literally vanish from under you if you don’t have the fare.
If an adventurer falls off the train or is kicked off while
the train is in the Spirit Realm, they may land on the
ground beneath them or, because of the magical nature of
the train, they can land on a barstool in Okiri, or fall into a
strange void and land somewhere on Obojima.
See the spell Create Spirit Train Stop, for information
on how adventures can utilize the Wandering Line at
higher levels.

Who’s On the Train?
While the passengers of the Wandering Line are mostly
spirits who are traveling to and from the Spirit Realm, any
kind of character can be on the train, with the exception of
demons who are banished from the Spirit Realm. There is
always a passenger reading a newspaper or a pair of spirits
talking to one another.

The Trial of the
Coal Master
If an adventurer leaves the second car and enters the
caboose, they enter into the domain of the coal master, a
pocket dimension shaped by the character’s
mind. An adventurer might open the door
and be in a primordial forest or they
could open the door and instantly be
in the middle of a vast desert. Upon
entering the caboose, each adventurer might face their greatest
fear or be tempted with their
greatest desire.
SPIRIT COAL

If a party enters the caboose, each player can be
in their own reality. If the players are itching for
a fight, this is the place to give it to them as any
kind of monster can appear here.

This realm was created to slow and deter anyone who
snuck past the locks without permission. The room acts as
a distraction, holding onto the attention of a creature until
the train arrives at their destination, at which point they
are thrust out of the train.
Passing the Trial. Only after the adventurers face a test of
their mettle do they actually enter the caboose where the Coal
Master is. This in and of itself is an accomplishment as the
Coal Master rarely meets someone who can overcome his trial.

NPCs
Here are some other permanent denizens that adventurers
can find on the Wandering Line:
The Conductor (spirit). The Conductor is a high-strung,
fussy, and meticulous human-looking spirit who ushers
(and at times shoves) passengers onto the train in order
to keep things on time. The Conductor wears a spotless
uniform with white gloves and has a shiny whistle which
he blows precisely one minute before the train leaves the
stop. No one knows if the Conductor is an extension of the
Wandering Line or is an independent entity, but in either
case, they appear to move as one.
The Coal Master (spirit). The Coal Master is an enigmatic
spirit of great power, and like the Conductor, could be a part
of the Wandering Line or an entity unto himself. The Coal
Master dwells in the caboose, shoveling valuable spirit coal
into the firebox—a spirit with a large mouth that is everready to devour more spirit coal and power the train.
Some facts about the Coal Master:
◊ The Coal Master can shapechange into whatever he
wishes and his coal shovel can morph into any kind of
object or weapon.
◊ The Coal Master knows that most who come here are
wanting to take some of the spirit coal. He is always open
to striking a deal. A good deal is something that the Coal
Master can’t resist.
◊ No matter how hard you try, you can never see his face. It
is always in shadow, covered by his cowl, or obscured in
some strange way.
Salazar Sales (male elf). Salazar Sales is a refreshment
vendor turned entrepreneur who—in addition to snacks
and drinks—is up for selling all kinds of things. But Salazar
is slimy and driven by gold, and most of his “snacks’’ taste
terrible as he has been known to try and sell pond water
as an “elixir of refreshment” or repurpose leftovers from a
village food cart as “Salazar’s Crunchables”. Most people are
too polite to complain and for those that do, Salazar spins
a tale of how one needs to have a “refined palate for such
boutique cuisine”. Salazar is a fast-talking, snake oil salesman who will instantly make up products on the spot if he
thinks he can sell it to a naive buyer.
Montague P. Parrot (spirit). Montague is an anthropomorphic parrot spirit who wears a beret and makes a

shady living as a very adept pickpocket. Montague is quick
to correct anyone that the correct pronunciation of his
last name is “pah-ROW”. Montague and Salazar loathe one
another and try to keep at either end of the passenger car,
but they don’t miss an opportunity to steal away a customer
or make the other look a fool if they get a chance. Even
though they are enemies, they don’t expose the other’s
larceny to outsiders, as that would be bad for business.
While in the Physical Realm, Montague can change his
form, but one thing he can’t change is his voice and if
someone recognizes it, this makes Montague very nervous.
Montague can disappear in a puff of green feathers if things
get too heated.

Points of Interest
The Wandering Line can stop almost anywhere on Obojima,
but there are a few unique depots where an adventurer can
find special items, rare ingredients, and possibly uncover
a vital clue to a mystery. Most depots for the Wandering
Line are hard to find, but dig hard enough and ask the right
questions, and an adventurer can find themselves on board
and heading to a strange destination.
Here are some ideas for places where the Wandering Line
can go:
◊ The Underwater Depot. This depot is located far
offshore and deep underwater and can connect to the
adventure included in this book. For more information on
this location, read “Below the Shallows”.
◊ The Cloud Depot. If an adventurer takes the Wandering
Line to the Cloud Depot, the tracks at some point in the
journey suddenly leave the earth and head in a dizzying arc high into the clouds. The Cloud Depot has the
Floating Market where Bottled Lightning and Tears of the
Moon can be found if the right questions are asked.
◊ The Prison of Oghmai. This depot lies in the center of
Mount Arbora where Oghmai, the demon emperor of the
Nakudama, has been imprisoned since the Second Age.
◊ The Glittering Depot. This stop of the Wandering Line
lies in a long-forgotten mine near Toggle. The depot is at
the center of a maze of tunnels, some of which lead to
gem-encrusted caverns while others lead to the surface
and others lead to monster lairs.
◊ Island of Hmug. Hmug is an island far offshore of the
Land of Hot Water.

Adventure Hooks
Getting Spirit Coal. Every knowledgeable ingredient
hunter worth their salt is always on the lookout for spirit
coal as it is so rare and highly sought after. But even knowing how to get some spirit coal is an adventure in itself for
the information is not that easily obtained. While there
are chunks of it that can be found in Obojima, spirit coal is
basically only found in the hopper of the Wandering Line.

THE FOUR SWORD
SCHOOLS
Below, you will find specific information on the four sword schools of Obojima. To find an overview of sword schools, check
out page 18 in the Island chapter. In addition to standard training under a sword school, masters might ask their students
to take on challenges, quests, or community services. These special requests can be used as alternative ways to lower the
master’s AC when challenging them (see challenging the masters on page 18)

Canden and Moon’s
Academy of Swords
The swordplay of the Canden and Moon school is known
for its overall elegance and the suddenness of its strikes. It
is a fluid form that, when demonstrated by a true master,
is dazzling to behold. Critics call it overwrought and a form
that obsesses over looking good. Those who master the
technique find subtlety in its dance-like movements, which
allows them to strike from any direction at any moment
or to turn aside seemingly unblockable attacks. Those who
study under these masters learn to balance beauty and
strength in a manner unparalleled on the island.
Easily the largest sword school both in terms of size
and number of students, Canden and Moon have established their facility as an institution on Obojima, attracting
aspirants from around the island. The school—an ornate,
hexagonal structure built with a First Age aesthetic— takes
up an entire city block in what was once a boarding school
in the heart of Yatamon. The school surrounds a manicured
garden that doubles as a training ground, and most mornings at dawn, Master Canden can be found here practicing
his forms beneath his beloved maple tree.

The Masters
The masters Canden and Moon share a tremendous mutual
respect, and in the eyes of the residents of Yatamon, they
are larger than life figures who seem to have come out of a
bygone age of mythic heroes. They are almost universally
well regarded, and they are unblemished by controversy.
They have no political ambitions, but they wield tremendous political influence, nonetheless, and their reputation
as philosophers as well as warriors has made their council
highly sought after.
Though they hold no official title, Canden and Moon are
effectively Yatamon’s protectors. On the rare occasion that
violence threatens the city, they, along with their most senior
students, are often given a wide berth to handle the situation.

MASTER CANDEN

Philosophy
The school is governed by its motto, “right conduct and
proper form in every situation”. This is true of the sword
and in life, according to Master Moon. Service to the
community in addition to physical training is something
that the masters cultivate in their students, so much so
that unless a student has proved themselves in the eyes
of the community, they are prohibited from challenging the masters to earn their mastery. The school’s
emphasis on discipline, tradition, and service
has made it a popular place for parents to send
kids. Most students never go on to earn their
mastery, and it’s fairly common to meet
folks around the island who’ve at least
spent a summer learning here.

116

MASTER
MOON

Master Canden (male human). In the eyes of new
students, Master Canden’s stern face and measured speech
is intimidating and mysterious. In truth, Carmine Canden
is an exceedingly patient teacher who sees the best in his
pupils. But he is not a coddler. He holds to the idea that
mastery comes with work and dedication. He also teaches
that skill without purpose is meaningless, and therefore,
service to others is part of the school’s curriculum. While
the old master is utterly devoted to the sword, it is the
school’s charitable work that he is most proud of.
Master Moon (female human). Master Moon is the
embodiment of elegance and her presence is imposing. Her
movements are so majestic that she, at times, appears otherworldly. Her grace and precision with a sword is likely unrivaled on the island, and even Master Canden believes hers to
be the most technically competent hands with a sword that
he’s ever seen. Even so, pupils soon learn that Master Moon
is indeed of this realm. She is quick to laugh and she has a
passion for reading and reciting humorous poetry.

Studying at the School
Masters Canden and Moon run a regimented school.
Students are expected to stay in the attached dormitory,
which must be kept orderly. At dawn, instruction begins in
the inner courtyard. This is where techniques are demonstrated and drilled. After lunch, students are expected
to engage in acts of service as a gesture of thanks to the
community that offers order and comfort they all enjoy.
The masters consider these acts of service to be so critical
to the school’s curriculum that only students who have
proved themselves to be humble servants to the good of
the community are able to try their hands at dueling the
masters and ultimately learn the master technique.
Below are some possible acts of service that students can
participate in, but feel free to create your own. Guard Duty.
The city watch is made up of volunteers, though its ranks
are often bolstered by students from the sword school.
Students who opt into a tour of duty with the watch might
spend their days breaking up the occasional brawl, investigating thefts, or helping residents drive off spirit pests.
Act as Judge. The school’s reputation for integrity means
requests come in frequently soliciting the services of someone who can judge a local contest. There might be a parade,
where contestants build elaborate floats. Or perhaps there’s
a festival to crown the city’s top street busker. It could be a
taste test or even a dance off.

make their way down here, some of them quite hostile to trespassers. Due to such dangers, sword school students are often
called upon to accompany them into the subway system.

Master Technique—
The Inscrutable Sword
Canden and Moon’s master technique—the inscrutable
sword—describes an approach to fighting that emphasizes
swiftness and keeping the opponent unsure whether attacking or defending.
Students who defeat either of the masters in the
school’s ritual duel gains access to a feat that represents
mastery of Canden and Moon’s technique. For more on the
feat, see page 162.

Challenging the Masters
A student can challenge one of the masters to a ritual
duel during one of the school’s four testing periods if the
masters have deemed the student ready for the attempt. For
more on the duel see page 18.
The duel is not a normal combat encounter, as it is not
about reducing hit points. The only information you need
to run a master through duel is listed in the section below.
Each master incorporates an aspect of their school’s master
technique when they duel.

117

Lom and Salt’s
College of Arms
The College of Arms is the oldest of
Obojima’s sword schools, dating back to
the early days of the Nakudama Age. It also
remains unique in its approach. Students here
not only learn the rudiments of swordsmanship
but those who can convince the masters Lom and Salt
will be taught the school’s tradition of swordsmithing.
Blades crafted by either of the masters are works of art
and are coveted by blade aficionados around the island. It’s
no secret that the masters of the other schools wield them.

MASTER SALT

MASTER LOM

The journey here is no easy achievement. In addition to
its ancient origins, it is also the most remote of the sword
schools, nestled in the upper reaches of Mount Arbora, cut
into the very stone of the mountainside. According to the
masters, those who make the ascent have taken the first
step toward tempering the body and honing the will.

Philosophy
The philosophy that guides the masters is a simple one that
has been passed down through the generations. A sword
is a thing of terrible potential. To make one is to bring into
the world the chance to do great harm. To Lom and Salt, it
is their responsibility to ensure that those who would wield
their swords or swords made in their tradition are worthy to
do so—that such swords are drawn for the right reasons.

The Masters
Lom and Salt have served as masters together for the past
six years. Salt, the senior master, mentored Lom, and when
Salt’s previous partner passed away, the new mastership
passed to Lom. Hard-won mutual respect describes the
relationship between them more than friendship, however.
It is the reverence they share for the swordsmith craft that
binds them. In the absence of students, the pair might
never speak, preferring instead to communicate with each
other using an ad hoc sign language that they developed
over the years.
Master Lom (female human). Master Lom has a rough
but friendly manner, with a sarcastic sense of humor. She
lovingly calls new students ingots, a nod to the potential
that exists in everyone to become something greater than
they are. Just as an ingot can be worked and honed into a
blade, so too can a person transform into something beautiful and useful. She believes this fully, as it is the path
she took herself, and she is known to take under her wing
students with a troubled past.
Before dedicating herself to swordcraft, Lom had an
unsavory past as part of a bandit company that raided
settlements in the foothills of Mount Arbora. When word
reached her that a cache of prized swords was being kept at

118

the College of Arms, she led a handful of brigands up the
mountain to steal them. There, she first encountered Master
Salt, who fought off the attack by herself. Lom was in awe.
She surrendered to Salt and pleaded to learn her craft. Salt
initially dismissed the bandit, and it took Lom years of
making amends for past deeds before she was accepted as
Salt’s disciple. But once accepted, she quickly took to her
new trade and proved a talented warrior and smith.
Master Salt (female elf). It is said that the grim-faced
master was born with a hammer in one hand and tongs
in the other, such is the natural gift she possesses when it
comes to forging swords. This is likely an exaggeration, but
not by much, having grown up at the school among the din
of hammers on metal. Even as a child, her skill had been
recognized and fostered. She would spend weeks on end at
the forge, working the metal to “free the blade within,” as
she once said to her mentor. Little has changed since. She is
tireless before the forge. When she starts a project, she dons
her headphones, and with the sound of synth-pop in her
ears, she strikes the first blows with her hammer.
With her reputation as a smith, her skill as a duellist
could easily be overlooked. Her endurance is legendary,
and she prefers to win by outlasting her opponent. It is this
skill that she hopes to impart to her students—endure. She
speaks little, and when she does, it’s usually little more
than a whisper. But one idea that she repeats is that
“Things will get hard. Endurance allows us to act without
rashness—the source of all mistakes.”

Proving One’s Worth
“A sword is heavy in the worthy hand.” This is engraved
upon the wall in the school’s common room, which might
have been a temple in ancient days. When it was written is
uncertain, and some even believe it predates and presages
the arrival of the first swordmasters.
Students who wish to possess the secret techniques of
the school must demonstrate not only how to use their
sword, but also when to draw it. Therefore, part of studying here means the masters will likely send a student on
an errand meant to be a test of character. How a student
performs on these errands tells the masters whether or not
that student is ready to progress in training.
The masters measure a student’s actions on these errands
using the following four virtues:
◊ “I drew my blade in defense.”
◊ “I drew my blade to help another.”
◊ “I kept a sword from an unworthy hand.”

Master Technique—
Forging a Blade
The master technique that students can learn at the College
of Arms is not in the wielding of swords but in their
creation. A student worthy in the eyes of the masters is
welcomed into a secret sanctum—a special forge, where
they are to forge a blade of their own under the tutelage of
both masters. The process takes approximately two weeks to
complete the blade.

Selecting Metal for the Blade
Before work can begin on the blade, the student is brought
into a small storeroom where ingots of different metals are
kept. Each metal, when added to the steel alloy, grants the
new blade a certain property. Most blades the masters make
contain two metals. Any more would make the blade unstable and prone to splintering. The student is allowed to select
the two metals they would like to include in their blade.

◊ “I did not draw my blade.”

The Metals. Below is a description of each metal and the
properties they add to a blade.

Challenging the Masters

◊ Cobalt: This metal makes a blade glow blue in the presence of spirits. The light radiates like that of a torch.

If the masters agree that a student has demonstrated the
right quality of character, that student can challenge one of
them to a ritual duel during one of the school’s four testing
periods. For more on the duel see page 18.

◊ Copper: This metal makes a blade forged with it a natural
defense against electricity. While wielding this blade you
reduce incoming Lightning damage by your proficiency
bonus.

The duel is not a normal combat encounter, as it is not
about reducing hit points. The only information you need
to run a master through a duel is listed in the section below.
Note that these masters don’t have special dueling techniques. Their specialty is in the forging of blades.

◊ Lead: This metal gives a blade made with it a mild nullifying effect on unwanted magic, granting its wielder
advantage on a saving throw against magic once a day.

Challenging Master Lom

◊ Zinc: This metal gives a blade a musical property when
it’s drawn from its scabbard or swung through the air. Its
high, whistling tone causes most animals to react strongly
to it. When the blade’s wielder swings it, they can gain
expertise on rolls made for animal handling and intimidation as long as the target of the roll is a beast.

Once the blade has been forged, have the
player describe their character’s sword. What
does the blade of the sword look like? Is it singleedged or double? How is the handle wrapped?
Does it have a crossguard or other kind of hand
protection? How about the scabbard? Does the
sword have a name?

Tellu and Scale’s
School of Blades
By the standards of Obojima’s other sword schools, Tellu
and Scale’s is quite unconventional. The school has no
permanent location and no fighting manual. As Tellu and
Scale migrate around up and down the western coast of the
island, the school sets up camp wherever they stop, and the
masters will teach whatever techniques or bits of wisdom
they deem worthy at the moment. Their teaching style is
intuitive rather than academic—from the gut and the heart
more than the head.
Tellu and Scale’s school is the newest and it is also the
smallest in terms of how many students it has at any given
time. This suits the offbeat masters fine, as they are fully
aware their style isn’t for everyone. Some students inevitably feel lost without the rigid structure that the other
schools offer while others get frustrated by training that is
not obviously relevant to swordsmanship. To the students
who choose to leave their tutelage, Scale addresses them
upon their departure, telling them that expectations can be
shackles, and to return when they’re ready to let go.

Philosophy
What prompted Tellu and Scale to form their unique school
is a rejection of what they have come to call “the brittleness
of forms.” Both masters emphasize a spontaneous style that
comes from the swordsman’s intuition. Instead of stifling
that intuition with rigid techniques, they aim to prime
their students with conditioning that focuses on balance
and bold creativity. Learning comes from living. The end
goal is to foster a flexible mind, which results in a flexible
fighting style.

The Masters
Tellu and Scale are like brothers. They share a love of
swords and the sea. They became maritime adventurers on behalf of the Mariners’ Guild, and in that time,
they bonded over the philosophy of Flowow, the ancient
Nakudama thinker who wrote, The Tempered Mind, which
became the cornerstone of their approach to the sword.
The masters each wield a blade which was crafted by the
other—tokens from their time spent at the sword school on
Mount Arbora, which has since become the school of the
masters Lom and Salt.
Master Tellu (male Nakudama). The stout master is as
wide as he is tall, solidly built, and rarely still. He has
a jovial manner, with a smile that seems fixed on
his face. He has won great renown for his skill
with a two-handed sword, though he usually
laughs it off. The Nakudama has come to
love instructing students, particularly
new ones. Before dispensing a bit
of particularly deep wisdom, he is

120

known to drink a potion that causes a long beard to sprout
from his chin, allowing him to stroke it as he pontificates.
Master Tellu is an accomplished sand sculptor in the
tradition of the people of Tidewater, who use magic to
create permanent structures from sand. For more information on Tidewater and sand sculpting, see page 36.
Master Scale (male human). Scale has a down-to-earth
and remarkably easy-going disposition. At times, it makes
him come off as a fool and he is often underestimated, a
fact that he might actually cultivate. As an instructor, he
is full of encouragement, though he has been known to go
hard on cocky students. Scale’s expertise is at dueling with
one-handed blades, an art he has honed since he lost one
of his arms in the jaws of a mighty sea spirit many years
ago. The ordeal did nothing to dampen his spirits, however.
If anything, he came to regard his world as even more
wondrous, and that life is full of unexpected turns and
developments. The best anyone can do is ride the wave, a
skill that takes practice and confidence.
Scale is far older than he appears. His prolonged youth is
the direct result of his encounter with the sea spirit. Long
ago, this spirit challenged Scale to a duel. This was nothing
special for the spirit, who had done this every generation
for centuries. Scale, who was then known as Koren, was a
new sword master, whose rising fame captured the spirit’s
attention. The two fought—a battle that lasted a day and a
night. At last, the spirit chomped down on Koren’s arm. The
pain was nigh unbearable, but it was enough to let him close
in and drive his sword through the spirit’s eye. Impressed
with the mortal’s resolve and willingness to suffer harm, the
spirit decided to spare Koren, and actually transferred to him great power.
At this moment, Koren became
Scale, a testament to the connection
between mortal and spirit.
MASTER SCALE

MASTER TELLU

Studying at Tellu and Scale’s
Students who come under the tutelage of Masters Tellu and
Scale should expect a loose and flexible instructional style.
Meanwhile, the masters expect their students to be earnest
in all things and approach learning with an open mind. The
masters hold lessons when the mood strikes them, at any
time of day or night.
Lessons with Master Tellu often revolve around toughening up the body, which he claims is the key to controlling
it. “A body unfamiliar with hardship doesn’t know what
it’s capable of.” Master Scale emphasizes the versatility of
thought that encourages students to find novel ways to
overcome problems and enemies.
Both masters expect their students to explore on their
own as well. They’ll assign challenges meant to test a
student’s skill and push their will. These challenges might
be a single feat or a kind of short quest. Below is a list of
possible challenges, but feel free to create your own. The
number of challenges that a character needs to complete to
demonstrate their mastery is up to you, as is the duration of
each one. Reward creativity.
Phalanx of Sand. One of the challenges that Master Tellu
administers is a test of strength where students must
charge through a gauntlet of sand structures created by the
master himself. The structures are roughly humanoid in
shape and spaced several feet apart in a long line. Master
Tellu sets one minute on his First Age stopwatch, and the
challenger must get through all the structures in that time
using only their body to do so. Pushing through a structure
requires a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. If a
challenger succeeds five times before three failed attempts,
they win the challenge. You can change the numbers as you
see fit, however.
Fresh Fruit. According to this challenge, all one has to do
is bring back a piece of fruit before it goes bad. This can’t
just be any fruit, however. It must be a prickly peach—a
delicate fruit that bruises easily and rots after two days of
being plucked from its tree. The prickly peach is found in
one place, as far as the masters know, which is in a wild
orchard in the southern reaches of the Gale Fields. The
journey typically takes over a week on foot, so it requires
some creative thinking to solve. There is no single correct
method for accomplishing this challenge, so reward creative
solutions. One thing to note is that when a prickly peach is
picked, it gives off a rich, sweet aroma that attracts harpies.
Message in a Bottle. This challenge speaks to Master
Scale’s love of diving. In the Shallows, not far from the
beach, there’s a narrow trench that contains the hull of a
sunken ship. Master Scale writes a message in a bottle, and
places the bottle in a chest in the hull of the ship. All the
challenger has to do is discover the contents of the message
and relay it to the master. The challenger can’t use magic,
but it’s otherwise up to them how they will accomplish
the task. To add difficulty, the ship can be occupied by a
monster or two.

Master Technique—
The Versatile Blade
Tellu and Scale’s master technique is all about keeping your
enemy off balance. By design, the technique has no
formal name.
Students who defeat either of the masters in the school’s
ritual duel gain access to a feat that represents mastery
of Tellu and Scale’s technique. For more on the feat, see
page 164.

Challenging the Masters
A student can challenge one of the masters to a ritual
duel during one of the school’s four testing periods if the
masters have deemed the student ready for the attempt. For
more on the duel see page 18.
The duel is not a normal combat encounter, as it is not
about reducing hit points. The only information you need
to run a master through a duel is listed in the section below.

Toraf and Boulder’s
School of Guts & Grit
A squat, square tower built of stone looks out over the Brackwater Wetlands from its perch on the southernmost point of
the Pale Hills, which run north to south through the region.
Once a hunting lodge in the days of the Nakudama monarchy, the swordmasters Toraf and Boulder have adopted it as
the location of their school, where they teach students to
battle the dangers that lurk in the wildest part of Obojima.
The students who find their way here are often attracted
by the school’s reputation for its no-frills grit. And that
suits Toraf and Boulder just fine, for those who seek out
the masters’ tutelage must be ready to prove their guts and
bravery. Unlike other schools, Toraf and Boulder prefer field
training to drills. There’s always some peril that requires the
masters’ attention, so even the greenest students are expected
to join the masters on expeditions into the wetlands. The way
the masters see it, there’s nothing quite like the possibility
of real bodily harm to test one’s mastery. Those who are not
made of the hardiest stuff are quick to quit the school.

Philosophy
The whole philosophy of the school can be summed up
in the first thing Master Boulder says to new students: “If
it’s practical in a fight, use it. If it ain’t, it’ll get you killed.”
Everything else, Toraf and Boulder would argue, is a detail.

The Masters
Masters Toraf and Boulder are not friends. What binds
them is the fact that they simply have more contempt for
the other sword schools than they carry for each other. The
duo became masters; the pair who previously carried the
titles were killed by a sickness that had spread through the
wetlands. Before the old masters died, they summoned Toraf
and Boulder—their former disciples—to take up the charge.

he calls “hangnails.” Master Toraf lives to challenge himself
every day, and he expects his students to do the same.
Toraf has learned at every sword school on the island, and
he remains convinced that the other masters are too content
with the theory of fighting. Only at this school did he feel
challenged. After attaining mastery here, he offered his skills
to the highest bidder, working primarily as an armed escort
for merchants. It was in the service of one such patron that
he earned the nickname, “The Door,” because of his habit of
filling doorways entirely with his great bulk.
Master Boulder (male human). Master Boulder is the
consummate survivalist. He prefers to stay outdoors, and
unlike Master Toraf, he lives beyond the safety of the
school, in a nearby camp in the wilderness. In fact, as much
as the training he received from the previous masters of
the school, he credits his considerable skill at fighting to
years spent as a ranger of the Greenward Path, battling the
monsters that stalk the wetlands. He has a restless manner,
moving about in a semi-crouch as though he’s always a
moment away from pouncing on a foe just out of sight. He
speaks in a low voice that forces his students to lean in to
hear him. In the rare moments he is still, he busies himself
with honing his sword edge with a whetstone.
He is driven by his ranger’s oath to keep the region safe
from unspeakable dangers, and he speaks of them often
to his students. It’s good to be scared, according to Master
Boulder, for fear is the ultimate catalyst for action. The goal,
therefore, is to prepare the mind and body to be useful when
fear grabs hold, and not act like a buffoon.

Studying at Toraf and Boulder’s
In certain respects, it would make more
sense for the school to be called Toraf or
Boulder’s, as most students end up primarily following the teachings of one of
the masters. Students under Master
Toraf’s tutelage live at the school

At the school, they tend to stay out of each other’s way.
But occasionally, they spar to demonstrate techniques and
this is when the volatility of their relationship boils over, as
they inevitably come to blows.
Despite their differences, their teaching styles overlap in
that both give their version of tough love, and both are in
short supply of patience.
Master Toraf (male human). Master Toraf has a barking
way of speaking and he possesses but one volume—loud.
With his enormous frame, and onyx black armor and helm,
he looks like a monster from the wetlands. It might be
humorous if it wasn’t terrifying. The intimidating master
lives at the school. As a teacher, he’s not the nurturing sort,
and at any given moment, his bellows can be heard booming throughout the school as he rips a student’s technique to
shreds. He has a special name for those students who demonstrate what he calls a “special kind of stupid.” These students,

122

MASTER
TORAF

MASTER
BOULDER

and accompany the master on his many adventures into the
Brackwater Wetlands, where they aid wayward travelers in
need of help in the wilderness.
Master Boulder’s students are expected to camp in the
wilderness. Here, he leads them on expeditions to track down
some of the most dangerous monsters that stalk the wetlands.
Below is a list of possible expeditions into the Brackwater
Wetlands, but feel free to create your own. The number of
expeditions that a character needs to complete to demonstrate
their mastery is up to you, as is the duration of each one.
Hunt a Crawler. Master Boulder leads the students into
a particularly soggy part of the wetlands, which is a prime
hunting ground for crawlers. The assignment is to take
one down. This task could be made more difficult by having
another one show up during the fight or by having the
crawler dart deeper into the wetlands after snatching up
one of the students.
Hunt a Slime. Slime tracks heading out of the Brackwater
Wetlands have Master Boulder troubled. In this expedition,
students must track and bring down a dangerous slime
before it wanders into the Gale Fields. To complicate this,
you might want to have a band of howlers stalking the
students as they track their quarry.
Refugees in Peril. A disheveled and exhausted traveler
collapses on the steps of the school. In a rasping whisper,
he manages to say, “Hakumon’s” before falling unconscious.
After carrying the traveler to the infirmary, Master Toraf
assembles his students and tells them to see what’s happening at Hakumon’s Ramen Shop (see page 91 for more information about the ramen shop). In this instance, the ramen
shop has been overrun by a handful of vespoma, who have
been tormenting the patrons with their enchanting speech.
Expedition to Polewater. Master Toraf sends a handful
of students to Polewater on the eastern coast of the island
to help them rebuild after the recent tsunami decimated
the village. On the way, students might encounter refugees
leaving Polewater or members of the Courier Brigade having
trouble getting through the Wetlands. Once at the town, they
might become embroiled in the effects of the Corruption. For
more about the happenings in Polewater, see page 85.

Master Technique—
Grim Skill Set
Toraf and Boulder are inheritors of the school’s signature
technique, not its creator. Also called the Striking Snake, the
technique is actually three different strikes that each start
from the same guard position. A master of this technique
knows how to obscure the intended target until the last
possible moment when the sword stroke could land on the
enemy’s head, torso, or leg. The technique was first developed to directly counter certain monsters found in the Brackwater Wetlands, and it’s by battling those monsters that Toraf
and Boulder expect their students to learn to master it.

Students who defeat either of the masters in the
school’s ritual duel gain access to a feat that represents
mastery of Toraf and Boulder’s technique. For more on the
feat, see page 164.

Challenging the Masters
A student can challenge one of the masters to a ritual
duel during one of the school’s four testing periods if the
masters have deemed the student ready for the attempt. For

repare to set out on the road and explore the island
of Obojima! This chapter presents player-facing
material that will help you make a character for your
Obojima adventure. It’s meant to be used alongside the
Player’s Handbook.
In this chapter, you’ll find the following sections:
Ancestries of Obojima: This is an in-depth look at the
humans and elves of the island as well as an introduction to
two new ancestries—the frog-like Nakudama and the ever-curious dara. It also offers guidance on how to introduce other
D&D ancestries that are not canonically part of Obojima.

Backgrounds: Six new backgrounds will help build characters rooted in the world.
Languages: Three new languages.
Equipment & Mechanics: This is a collection of new
weapons, armor, and adventuring gear, as well a handful of
relics from the First Age.
Feats: Twenty new feats, some of which are unlocked
through the course of an adventure.
Skills: Two new skills that interact with the electronics and
machinery of the First Age.

Subclass Options: Eleven new subclass options that are
connected to the lore of Obojima.

ANCESTRIES OF OBOJIMA
The ancestries found on the island of Obojima include humans, dara, elves, and Nakudama. The culture and history of
the world is built around them and them alone. If you want to fully immerse yourself in the Obojima experience, you’ll
probably want to choose from among these ancestries.
That’s not to say you can’t play other ancestries. It just means you’ll have to introduce them to the island in your own
unique way. For adapting existing 5e ancestries, see page 130.

Humans

Dara

Though they were not the first to arrive on the island,
humans account for Obojima’s most plentiful people. Most
humans live in farming and fishing communities, preferring
a modest, quiet existence among close friends and family.
But it’s also within humans that the spark of adventure
burns brightest, and it’s not uncommon for humans to
yearn to travel the island and explore its mysteries for a
time before returning to a simpler life.

Dara are a mysterious people that emerged from the forests
of Obojima less than 300 years ago. No one knows if they
are from Obojima itself or if they came from another realm.
Even the dara themselves speculate as to their origin,
though most believe they are all descendents of an enigmatic figure known as the First Dara. What is known about
the dara is that they are insatiably curious, a gift they claim
is from their progenitor. Dara often gravitate toward being
wanderers, seeking out anything that interests them, and
many scrawl notes and sketches as they are observing. It’s
hard to know what a dara will be fascinated by next, as they
are just as interested in a small bug trundling over a leaf as
they are a sinuous dragon flying through the sky.

From the Sea
The humans of Obojima regard the island as home, but it’s
clear that it was not always so. Nakudama records tell of
the coming of humans on a fleet of ships that were scuttled upon landing. Whether these humans were refugees,
intrepid adventurers, or simply lost at sea remains unclear.
One interesting note from that time reaches us from a
scroll penned by the sage Ati the Learned who referred to
the event in several places as the return of the humans.
The “return theory”, as current historians call it, is hotly
debated, though it’s clear that First Age technology is curiously connected to humans.

A Message From the Past
Dara possess a unique gift—the ability to absorb a vast
amount of information in an instant through contact with a
magical glyph. These magical symbols, which resemble large
fingerprints, are found on trees throughout Obojima and
can only be seen by dara. A dara who touches one of these
glyphs taps into its reservoir of knowledge. Through it, a
dara could learn not just information, but also new skills.
It is widely believed that many of these glyphs were left by
the First Dara to guide future generations.

125

Dara Lifecycle

Dara Traits

It’s widely understood that one dara’s life begins where
another ends. When a dara is about to die, their final act
is to capture what remains of their soul and store it into
a single glyph, which they place upon a tree. Known as a
parting glyph, it is imbued with the dying dara’s identity,
memories, and skills. There, the glyph waits until it can be
claimed by a new dara.

Your dara character gains traits that enable it to traverse
and flourish on the island of Obojima.

A dara is born from the earth, emerging into Obojima,
fully formed, through the roots of a tree that bears a parting
glyph. Most are born from trees in the sacred grove in Roa
Kala, the ancestral homeland of the dara (see page 94 for
more on Roa Kala), but it could be anywhere a dara has died.
When a dara leaves the soil, they are a blank slate, aware
and without identity until they touch the parting glyph
found at the base of their tree.
Parting glyphs give young dara a set of intellectual tools
to function. In the form of memories, the glyphs offer the
previous dara’s perspective about a world yet to be experienced. For many dara, the parting glyph leads them to Roa
Kala and from there they choose their new life.

Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice
increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice
increases by 1.
Age. From the moment dara pop into existence they have
all basic motor functions mastered. By the time a month
has passed they are a fully functioning member of society.
It’s unknown how long a dara can live for, but the average
is roughly 100 years.
Alignment. Dara tend to lead slow-paced observant lives.
Their natural curiosity and desire to learn often leads them
down a life as passive bystanders. They’re not easily swayed
and tend to stay neutral both in conflict and life.
Size. Dara naturally come in a variety of sizes ranging
anywhere from 2 to 7 feet tall, with a weight between 65
and 300lbs. Your size is either small or medium depending
on which type of dara you are: Small (red) or Medium (blue)
Speed. Your base walking speed is based on your size: 25
feet if you’re Small, or 30 feet if you’re Medium.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and
one other language of your choice.
Awakened Skills. You gain proficiency in three skills of
your choice.
Create Talisman. As an action, you can create a magical
paper talisman, which can bestow unique abilities to any
creature in possession of it. When you do so, choose one of
the following forms for the talisman:
◊ Sun Talisman. A creature in possession of this talisman can use its bonus action to activate the talisman, granting it the benefit of the Disengage or Dash
action (its choice).
◊ Earth Talisman. When a creature in possession of
this talisman is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed
outright, the talisman activates, causing the creature to
drop to 1 hit point instead.
◊ Moon Talisman. This paper talisman can be placed on
any weapon as an action. The next time this weapon
successfully hits a target, the talisman activates,
dealing extra radiant damage equal to your level.
The talisman lasts for 1 hour or until it is activated.
Once you use this trait, you can’t do so again until
you finish a long rest.
Sacred Revelation. You possess an innate gift allowing you to perceive and absorb information from the
peculiar glyphs strewn across the island. These glyphs take
the form of intricate symbols resembling thumbprints
and hold the potential to convey anything from simple

126

messages, to complex skills to you. As an action you can
touch and absorb any information stored inside one of
these glyphs.
Impart Knowledge. In Dara culture, the individuals who go
on to obtain wisdom truly worth sharing are blessed with
a unique ability to impart glyphs before their death. This
extraordinary skill is revered amongst the dara.
When you reach 10th level, you gain the ability to impart
messages through dara glyphs. As an action you can press
your hand against any surface and create a thumbprint
shaped glyph unique to you. When creating this glyph you
recite a message, which is stored inside the magical symbol.
The glyph can only be seen by other dara and can be
absorbed by using the Sacred Revelation ability.

The Color of Dara
Dara come in two distinct forms, with many unique
features between them, but most refer to them by their
color: blue or red. There are no social differences between
blue and red dara, and they seem to appear in equal
numbers. The origin of the two types is unknown, though
there is a belief among them that the First Dara looked like
an amalgamation of both types.

BLUE DARA
Blue dara are usually between 6 and 7 feet tall, with bluehued skin and a single large eye found in the middle of
their head. Their body is completely void of hair and they’re
normally quite stout.

As a blue dara you gain the use of the knowledge talisman and are able to produce it once per day in addition to
other talismans you know.
Knowledge Talisman. As an action, you can create a knowledge talisman. When a creature in possession of this talisman
makes an ability check, it can activate the talisman, rolling a
d6 and adding the number rolled to the check; the creature
can roll the die before or after making the ability check. The
talisman lasts for 1 hour or until it is activated. Once you use
this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

RED DARA
Red dara are much shorter, with an average height between
2 and 3 feet tall. In addition to their smaller stature, they
are easily distinguished from their larger kin by the bright
red hue of their skin and their two eyes.
As a red dara you gain the use of the might talisman and
are able to produce it once per day in addition to other talismans you know.
Might Talisman. As an action, you can create a might talisman. When a creature in possession of this talisman makes
a saving throw, it can activate the talisman, rolling a d6 and
adding the number rolled to the save; the creature can roll
the die before or after making the saving throw. The talisman lasts for 1 hour or until it is activated. Once you use
this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Spirit Guide by Circumstance
Throughout the ages, the islanders and spirits have coexisted harmoniously, although it would be misleading to
claim that they always agree on everything. Consequently,
elves often find themselves acting as intermediaries
when conflicts arise between spirits and folk from the
Physical Realm.

Elf Traits
You, along with other elves, have been gifted a unique set of
traits akin to the spirits that inhabit the island of Obojima.
Ability Score Increase. One ability score of your choice
increases by 2, and another ability score of your choice
increases by 1.
Age. Elves reach adulthood in their late teens and live less
than a century.
Size. Elves vary in height, which ranges from 5 feet to well
over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range,
your size is Medium.
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common.

Elves
The elves of Obojima possess a deep and special bond with
the enigmatic Spirit Realm and its native spirits. Unlike
other inhabitants of the island, the elves do not form
distinct communities or enclaves as they are not a people
in the traditional sense. This is because elves are born to
human parents. While this occurrence is uncommon, it is
not so infrequent that it is met with disdain or apprehension. Instead, it’s simply understood that an elf exists with
one foot in two worlds.

Marked by the Spirits
Every elf shares common physical traits such as pointed
ears and their keen ability to see in the dark. However, what
sets Obojiman elves apart is the presence of Oaka Marks.
Each elf bears a unique mark that symbolizes their connection to the Spirit Realm. These mystical glyphs appear as
shimmering birthmarks and vary in size from that of a coin
to large enough to cover an entire limb.
Beyond being mere physical markers, Oaka Marks hold
deep significance for elves. They represent their profound
bond with the spirit world and have the potential to bestow
unique supernatural abilities.

128

Darkvision. Thanks to your supernatural gifts,
you have superior vision in dark and
dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it
were bright light, and in darkness as
if it were dim light. You can’t discern
color in darkness, only shades of gray.
Ethereal Sight. Your ocular prowess
doesn’t stop at darkvision.
Additionally, you can use
an action to shift your
sight into the ethereal,
allowing you to see creatures
on the Spirit Realm, which
appear as glowing outlines of
themselves. This effect lasts for 1
hour. You can use this trait a number
of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain all expended
uses of it when you finish a long rest.
OAKA MARK

OAKA BIRTHMARK
Courage. You know the Resistance* cantrip and can cast it
without requiring material components. When you reach
3rd level, you can cast Heroism* as a 2nd-level spell once
with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you
finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.
Fury. You know the Sacred Flame* cantrip. When you
reach 3rd level, you can cast Shatter* once with this trait,
requiring no material components, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your
spellcasting ability for these spells.
Harmony. You know the Guidance* cantrip. When you
reach 3rd level, you can cast Calm Emotions* once with this
trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish
a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these
spells.
Nature. You know the Dancing Lights* cantrip and can cast
it without requiring material components. When you reach
3rd level, you can cast Animal Messenger* once with this
trait, requiring no material components, and you regain
the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is
your spellcasting ability for these spells.

Nakudama

Purity. You know the Spare the Dying* cantrip. When you
reach 3rd level, you can cast Lesser Restoration* once with
this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you
finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.

A sweet treat left untasted, a hot spring left undipped in,
a warm fire left unshared—all considered tragedies by a
people driven to indulge in all the comforts and curiosities
Obojima has to offer. To the other peoples of the island, the
amphibious Nakudama seem to partake in all things with a
sense of eagerness and excitement.

Selflessness. You know the Resilient Friendship cantrip.
When you reach 3rd level, you can cast Gift once with
this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you
finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.

Nakudama tend to eschew enclaves for the more cosmopolitan settlements scattered across the island. They are
highly social. Patrons of tea houses, taverns, and inns are
sure to hear the booming, croaking voices of Nakudama
mingling with crowds.

Did I Ever Tell You the Story About…
NAKUDAMA
EGGS

Life is too short to spend time on anything not worth
recounting in an over-the-top tale later. Sharing and collecting stories is among the most cherished Nakudama traditions. It’s what motivates many Nakudama to travel the
island or frequent social gatherings. A quality story doesn’t
just happen, however. Any Nakudama will tell you it’s one
part lived experience and two parts showmanship, which
includes creative license and allows for at least a bit of exaggeration. The art can be practiced, but experience must be
earned. Therefore, Nakudama tend to venture out regularly
in search of novel stories to share.

Obojima’s Earliest Inhabitants (Perhaps)
Though the details have been lost to history or exaggerated
over years of storytelling, it is generally believed that the
Nakudama were the first people to call Obojima

129

home. Several sites around the island point to an ancient
Nakudama civilization, and many settlements appear to
incorporate Nakudama architecture, which is noteworthy
for its water features.
Other evidence that suggests an earlier Nakudama Age
comes from the tales, which are filled with the fantastical
feats of a powerful Nakudama queen. Though often overly
dramatic in the portrayals, her exploits seem to line up
with recent archaeological findings.

Nakudama Traits

SUBCLASSES
The section below details eleven new subclasses intertwined with the island of Obojima, its culture, and its creatures.
These variants of the classic archetypes are not the only character types you’ll find on the island, but they do provide a
playstyle that feels uniquely Obojiman.

Path of the Belly Brewer
Barbarian

These barbarians are masters of brewing potions on the
fly—directly in their guts! Where others must painstakingly prepare potions with finesse, they channel their inner
hunger to unlock the latent magic within raw ingredients
without any prep.
Those born with the rumble in their belly often find that
regular food can’t quite satisfy. They require something
more unusual. A generation ago, a handful of adventurous
eaters with the appetite set out to find a way to appease
their seemingly unappeasable appetites. This is how they

discovered “belly brewing.” Certain morsels consumed
together not only quieted the rumble for a time, but they
also yielded the potion-like effects they’ve since come to be
known for.

Belly Concoction
Starting at 3rd level, you learn the hard-earned skill of belly
brewing, an arcane technique in which you swallow, mix,
and brew magical concoctions inside your gut, creating a
number of unique effects.
When you enter your rage, you focus your energy to
harness and activate the effects of a belly concoction.
Choose combat, utility, or whimsy. You gain the effects of
the chosen belly concoction, as detailed below. You can
change your belly concoction each time you rage.

COMBAT
Your body undergoes a unique change which magically
alters your physical form, giving it the characteristics of
rubber. While in this elastic state, you can use your reaction
when you are hit by a ranged attack, deflecting it with your
belly. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack
is reduced by 1d12 + your Constitution modifier + your
barbarian level.
Additionally, immediately before you make a melee
weapon attack on your turn, you can use your bonus action
to stretch your arms, increasing your reach by 5 feet for the
rest of the turn. The first time you hit while your arms are
stretched in this way, the attack deals an extra 1d6 damage
of the weapon’s type.

UTILITY
The bubbling elixir in your stomach is perfectly mixed to
dissolve and absorb anything you can swallow. As a bonus
action, you can consume any object you can fit in your
mouth. When you do so, you can expend one of your Hit
Dice as part of this bonus action to heal yourself. Roll the
die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number
of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1). Swallowing
an object in this way destroys it, provided the object isn’t
magical. You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
when you finish a long rest.

132

WHIMSY
You focus on the magical brew inside you, only to get an array
of strange and unruly effects. While in this state, you gain one
of the following effects at the start of each of your turns:
◊ You teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you
that you can see.
◊ You take 1d4 necrotic damage; the next ability check you
make before the end of your turn gains a bonus equal to
the number rolled.

Mighty Quick Brew
Starting at 14th level, you learn an additional common
potion as well as an uncommon potion, using your Quick
Brew feature.
Each time you gain a level in this class, you can swap one
of your chosen potions with a different one.

◊ You can immediately take the Help action as a
bonus action.
Additionally, you gain a random visual effect that accompanies the other whimsical features, such as your hair turns
to moss, a spectral bird circles above your head, or a tattoo
of a dancing man appears on your person and moves about
your body.

Side Effects
At 3rd level, you gain a number of magical side effects due
to the countless magical ingredients you’ve ingested. You
learn the Prestidigitation* and Thaumaturgy* cantrips.

Quick Brew
Beginning at 6th level, you’ve learned how to better control
the effects your belly concoction produces.
Choose a common potion that you would normally
consume. You can activate the effects of the chosen potion
as a bonus action. Once you activate it, you can’t do so again
until you finish a long rest. If the potion’s effects require a
saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus +
your Constitution modifier.
Each time you gain a level in this class, you can swap
your chosen potion with a different one.
An alternate way of using this feature is to
only allow the player to choose from a list of
potion recipes that they’re aware of. If the belly
brewer has yet to learn any potion recipes, then
the GM should provide a list of 10 options to
choose from.

College of Masks
Lingering Effects
At 10th level, the ever-present concoction in your stomach
is now so potent it grants you benefits even when you
aren’t raging.
When you finish a long rest, choose one of the following
conditions: blinded, charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, or stunned.
You have advantage on saving throws against that condition
until you choose a different one with this feature.

Bard

To be a bard from the College of Masks is to be a theater
actor capable of losing themselves in a role by using masks
they imbue with magic. Through these masks, bards can
mimic others and even take on attributes of the personas
their masks depict.
To see the world through another’s eyes. To show the
world a face not your own. To become someone else. These
are the actor’s pursuits. Some local players might putter

133

about on the stage as a hobby or distraction, but not bards
of the College of Masks. Like liquid bronze being poured
into a mold, these actors have turned their sense of self
into a malleable thing able to transform themselves into
someone else.

Tradition of Performance
The College of Masks not only describes the bard, but it
also refers to an Obojiman theater tradition where a solitary
masked actor plays out a story from the island’s myths and
folktales, which feature a set of archetypal characters such
as the Old Man, the Fish, and the Demon, among others.
Throughout the show, the actor artfully shifts between
masks depicting each character. Each performance is its
own special thing, as no two are the same.

Alter Self
Change Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide what you look like, including
your height, weight, facial features, sound of
your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. You can make
yourself appear as a member of another race,
though none of your statistics change. You also
can’t appear as a creature of a different size than
you, and your basic shape stays the same; if
you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become
quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the
duration of the spell, you can use your action to
change your appearance in this way again.

Tools of Performance

Many-Masked Performance

When you join the College of Masks at 3rd level, you gain
the ability to weave arcane boons into theater masks, which
grant you abilities while you wear them. You craft two
masks of your choice, which are detailed under the “Masks”
section below. You’re able to craft one additional mask of
your choice when you reach 7th, 11th, and 15th level in this
class. Each time you craft a new mask, you can also replace
one mask you’ve already crafted with a different one.

At 6th level, you gain the ability to enthrall an audience
with a dramatic performance. Over the course of 1 minute,
you can engage in a captivating performance and attempt to
cause nearby creatures to become charmed, frightened, or
fall unconscious (your choice). Choose a number of creatures up to your bard level within 60 feet of you that can
hear you. When the performance ends, each target must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
DC or be subjected to the chosen condition.

While wearing a mask you gain the abilities granted by
it. You can don or swap masks as an action or bonus action.
If an ability from a mask requires a saving throw, the DC is
equal to your bard spell save DC.

Copycat
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to quickly shift
your appearance to match that of a person. As an action,
you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration to cast the
Alter Self* spell, using the spell’s Change Appearance
option to transform into another humanoid you have seen.
When cast in this way, the spell has the following changes:
◊ It doesn’t require your concentration, but you can still
end the spell at any time (no action required).
◊ You gain 5 temporary hit points, and the spell ends early
if you lose all these hit points or die.
◊ You gain new equipment that you would associate with
the target and are aware of it possessing, such as its clothing, armor, weapons, and other small belongings. Any
equipment gained in this way has no magical properties,
even if the original object used by the target does.
◊ Any equipment you were wearing or carrying merges
into your new form and you can’t activate, use, wield, or
otherwise benefit from any of it.

134

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.

Gift of Theatre
At 14th level, you gain the ability to give one of your theater
masks to an ally within 5 feet of you. As an action, you
temporarily release the incantation that binds your theater
mask to you, allowing one of your allies to use it. The mask
can be used in this way for 1 minute and only one other
creature can be designated to use it.
Once you’ve given an ally a theater mask, you can’t do so
again until you finish a short or long rest.

Masks
The masks are presented in alphabetical order.
Demon (7th Level Required). While wearing this mask you
gain the abilities Arcane Memory and Demon Eye.
◊ Arcane Memory. While wearing this mask, you can use
an action and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to
magically learn whether a creature or object you specify
has been within a 20-foot radius of your current location
in the past 24 hours. If you expend a spell slot of 3rd level
or higher, you get a brief vision of the creature or object
while it was there, and you learn the exact time the creature or object was present.

◊ Demon Eye. As an action, you gain the ability to magically see through solid objects to a range of 15 feet. Your
vision penetrates most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot
of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or
3 feet of wood or dirt.
Harpy (11th Level Required). While wearing this mask
you have a flying speed of 30 feet and resistance to
psychic damage.
Fish. While wearing this mask you gain a swimming speed
equal to your walking speed and the ability to breathe
underwater. Additionally, you know the Water Bullet and
Whelm Weapon spells.
Fox. While wearing this mask, you can move through a
hostile creature’s space, regardless of its size, and another
creature’s space isn’t difficult terrain for you. Additionally,
your AC increases by 1 and when you make a Dexterity
saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage
on the roll.
Golem (7th Level Required). While wearing this mask, your
weapon attacks deal an extra 1d8 damage on a hit. If you are
Small, you don’t have disadvantage on your attack rolls with
weapons as a result of the heavy property. In addition,
your attacks and spells deal double damage to objects
and structures.
Old Man. While wearing this mask, you can cast Detect
Magic* and Identify* at will, without expending a spell slot
or material components.
Protagonist. When you roll initiative while wearing this
mask, you gain temporary hit points equal to half your bard
level (rounded up). As a bonus action, you can mark a creature as your antagonist for 1 minute. For the duration, you
have advantage on ability checks involving your antagonist.
Additionally, when you see your antagonist make an attack,
you can use your reaction and expend a use of your Bardic
Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die to reduce the
attack roll by the number rolled on the die.
Sea Urchin. While wearing this mask, you can use a bonus
action and expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration, rolling
a Bardic Inspiration die to heal yourself for a number of hit
points equal to the number rolled plus half your bard level
(rounded up).

Additionally, you can use an action to attempt to immobilize a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, injecting it
with magical toxins. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving
throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. You can use
this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency
bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you
finish a long rest.
Spirit (7th Level Required). While wearing this mask, you
know the Speak with Dead* spell. Additionally, you can
expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to temporarily move
through the Spirit Realm. Whenever you would move, you
instead step through the veil and into the Spirit Realm in
the area where it overlaps with your current plane. You
remain in the Spirit Realm until you stop moving or your
turn ends. If you occupy the same spot as a solid object or
creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted
to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and
take 1d10 force damage.
While on the Spirit Realm, you can only affect and be
affected by other creatures on that plane. Creatures that
aren’t in the Spirit Realm can’t perceive you and can’t
interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has
given them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and
effects that aren’t on the Spirit Realm, allowing you to move
through objects you perceive on the plane you originated
from. This effect lasts until the end of your turn.
Stone Mask. While wearing this mask, you gain proficiency in the Athletics skill and all bludgeoning, piercing,
and slashing damage you take from nonmagical attacks is
reduced by 2. Additionally, you have advantage on ability
checks and saving throws against being pushed, pulled, or
knocked prone while wearing the mask.

Circle of the Petal
Druid

In the tranquil groves where nature’s harmony sings loudest, there exists a circle of druids attuned to the delicate
dance of petals upon the breeze. These druid guardians of
the natural world, known as the Circle of the Petal, draw
their power from the spirit of Obojima, the steady island
breeze and the ephemeral beauty and resilience of flowers.
Embracing these subtle powers, they harness the whispers
of the wind and the gentle caress of petals to weave their
enchantments and shape the world around them.
Members of the Circle of the Petal are revered for their
deep connection to the sacred dawn petal tree and their
ability to evoke its serene splendor in both peaceful
sanctuaries and in dire situations. These druids become
conduits of life energy, channeling the essence of blossoms
into healing balms, protective barriers, and devastating
bursts of floral fury. Guided by the eternal cycle of growth,
bloom, and decay, they embody the ever-renewing vitality
of nature, ensuring that even in the darkest of times, hope
blossoms anew like petals on the wind.

Petal Dance
At 2nd level, you become permeated with the spirit of
Obojima and are now able to control a fraction of Obojima’s
magic that manifests as flower petals of the druid’s choosing. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild
Shape to call on this power and conjure a resilient cloud of
petals that functions as an extension of your own being. This
cloud lasts for 1 hour. While enveloped by the cloud, your AC
increases by 1 and you gain the following benefits.
As a bonus action, you can cause your petals to
lunge toward a creature you can see within 30 feet of
you, slashing at its body. Make a ranged spell attack
against the target using your spell attack bonus.
On a hit, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage.
This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th
level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
Additionally, when you or a creature you can see
within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can use
your reaction to reduce that damage by an amount
equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.
Once you’ve used your petal cloud in this way, the
cloud dissipates.

Petal Beast Mimicry
At 6th level, you gain the ability to imbue life into your
petals. As an action, you can summon a spirit that has the
appearance of a creature of your choice. This spirit arrives as
a great wind that overtakes the petals before transforming
into the desired beast, which you control. The spirits uses
the bestial spirit statistics, with the following changes:

136

◊ Its hit points are equal to three times your
druid level.
◊ When it takes the attack action its attack modifier is equal
to your spell attack modifier.
◊ In addition to its walking speed, it has a flying speed of 20
feet and can hover.
◊ It can move through the space of other creatures as if they
were difficult terrain.
The spirit appears in an unoccupied space of your choice
within 30 feet of you and acts on your turn. The spirit can
only take the Dash and Attack action. If the spirit is reduced
to 0 hit points, it explodes in a stunning spectacle of cascading petals. Until the end of your next turn, all creatures
within a 20-foot radius centered on the spirit are affected by
the Faerie Fire spell. Alternatively, the spirit disappears after
1 minute or if you dismiss it early (no action required).
Starting at 11th level, you can expend two uses of this ability to summon two bestial spirits, instead of one, when you
use this action.
You have two uses of this feature, and you gain an
additional use of it when you reach certain levels in this
class: 11th level (three uses) and 16th level (four uses). You
regain all expended uses of this feature
when you finish a long rest.

Spirit of Obojima
Starting at 10th level, the spirit of Obojima comes to your
aid in both subtle and grand ways. Whenever making a
Wisdom (Survival) check to find a path or creature, the
wind carries a collection of brilliant white petals in the
direction you seek. You have advantage when making these
skill checks.
Additionally, you can use an action to magically call forth
a massive swarm of petals, which create a great barrier. In
a space that you can see, a wall of shifting petals forms.
This wall is 1 foot thick, 15 feet tall, and up to 60 feet long.
It appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. If the wall cuts through a creature’s
space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of
the wall (your choice which side).
Nothing can physically pass through the wall except for
creatures designated by you. It is immune to all damage,
as the petals magically heal any hole that would be created
by an attack or effect. This wall lasts a number of minutes
equal to your druid level.
Once you use the petal barrier, you can’t use it again until
you finish a long rest.

Promising Threat. The bestial spirit has advantage
on Charisma (Intimidation) checks if the target has
seen it hit a creature with its chomp attack in the
past minute.

Actions

Starting at 14th level, the spirit of Obojima comes to your
aid in your times of greatest need. When you are reduced to
0 hit points, you instead regain half of your hit points and
are lifted to your feet amidst a turbulent tempest of petals.

Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is
a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving
throw or be knocked prone.

You can then immediately use your reaction to send a
wave of concussive wind sweeping out from you. Each
creature in a 10-foot radius centered on you must succeed
on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC
or be pushed 15 feet away from you and suffer 2d8
slashing damage.

Reactions
Devour. When the bestial spirit reduces a creature to 0
hit points, it consumes some of the creature’s essence,
regaining 1d10 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest
before you can use it again.

The Spirit-Fused
Fighter

Even the life of a spirit must come to an end.
Those who take on the moniker of a spirit-fused fighter
do not normally do so by choice but rather by circumstance. Because to become a spirit-fused fighter, you must
first become the vessel of a dying spirit, a task that can’t be
accomplished by choice, as no one truly understands how or
why this occurs.
All that is known is that the spirit's mind and body have
passed on, and its essence now coexists within the fighter,
granting them abilities beyond the capability of a normal
spirit. Those who can harness this power can channel the
latent energy into objects, which produce a magical quirk
or powerful attacks. These arcane tricks are how these
unconventional warriors fight and are the reason they have
garnered so much attention and interest on the island.

Arcane Quirk
As the host of a powerful spirit, the magic within you can
be strange and unruly. Though you’ve learned to control
your powers, the arcane energy can still spark to life, often
creating strange effects.
Choose one or more of the Arcane Quirks listed below:
◊ When activating any of the features from this subclass,
First Age technology around you begins to act haywire.
◊ Whenever you make a weapon attack, a radio or cassette
player on your person plays a snippet of a song.
◊ Whenever you take damage you cough bubbles.
◊ Spirits find your odor to be incredibly off-putting.
◊ Spirits find your odor to be incredibly attractive.
◊ When you are unconscious, your body floats 1 foot off the
ground and can be carried by the wind.
◊ When you successfully land a critical hit on a creature,
your head randomly transforms into a strange visage
such as an anthropomorphic pig head, a crimson-skinned
version of yourself with flaming locks, the face of an
Urugama, or a CRT TV. This transformation lasts until you
transform again or take a long rest.

Channel Essence
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel spirit
energy into your attacks. You have a pool of four d6s that
you spend to fuel this ability, which are called essence dice.
When you make a weapon attack roll against a creature,
you can expend a die from your pool to add it to the roll.
Alternatively, you can expend a die from your pool to add it
to the attack’s damage roll. You can choose to do this either
before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects
of the attack are applied.
You regain all of your expended essence dice when you
finish a short or long rest.
You gain an additional d6 for your essence dice pool at
certain levels in this class: 7th level (5d6), 10th level (6d6),
15th level (7d6), and 18th level (8d6).

Object Channeling
Beginning at 3rd level, you gain the ability to channel your
internal spirit energy into objects, creating an array of
effects. You learn one Channeling Option of your choice
(see “Channeling Options” below). In addition, you gain
an object of your choice that you can use to channel the
option through.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.
You also gain proficiency in the Salvage skill.

138

Spirit Battery
Starting at 7th level, you learn the Jolt cantrip with the
following changes:
◊ When you target a machine with the spell, the machine is
powered for 1 hour instead of 18 seconds.
◊ Your spell attack modifier is equal to your Constitution
modifier + your proficiency modifier.
Additionally, once on each of your turns when you hit a
target with a weapon attack as part of the attack action, you
can replace its damage with that of the Jolt cantrip. When
you do so, you roll the Jolt cantrip's damage dice (which
deals lightning damage) in place of the weapon's damage
dice, and you can gain no other benefits to the attack's
damage from other features or spells.
You count as the spirit creature type.

Improved Object Channeling
At 7th level, you learn an additional Channeling Option,
and you can now use your Object Channeling feature a
number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You
regain all of the expended uses when you finish a short or
long rest.

Improvised Armor
Starting at 10th level, you learn to channel your energy into
objects you are wearing, causing them to become harder
than steel for a brief moment. When you are hit by an
attack, you can use your reaction to roll one of your essence
dice, adding the number rolled to your AC for that attack,
potentially causing the attack to miss you.

Backup Battery
At 15th level, you learn to draw on the spirit energy within
you to gain a quick rush of energy. You gain an additional
use of your Second Wind feature. When your hit points
drop below your fighter level while you have a use of
Second Wind, you can choose to expend a use of Second
Wind immediately (no action required).

Junk Master
Starting at 18th level, you gain an additional channeling
option from the Object Channeling feature.
In addition, when you roll initiative and have no uses of
your Object Channeling feature left, you regain two uses of
that feature.

CHANNELING OPTIONS
The channeling options are presented in alphabetical order.
Ballooning Bag. As a bonus action, you cause a bag (such
as a canvas sack, backpack, fanny pack, or satchel) that you
are holding or is on your person to rapidly inflate with air.
The bag then floats upward, lifting you off the ground and
carrying you up to 30 feet straight into the air. You hover in
place there until you let go of the bag (no action required)
or until the start of your next turn, at which point the bag
gently floats back to the ground.
Alternatively, when falling you can use your reaction to
cause the bag to inflate, granting you the benefits of
Feather Fall*.
Entangling Cord. When taking the attack action, you can
choose to replace one of your attacks with an entangling
strike. Choose an object that features tendril-like properties
(such as a tape measure, game controller, extension cord,
rope, or chain). The object can be on your person or within
30 feet of you, provided you can see it.
When you do so, the object springs to life, stretching out
towards a creature you can see within 15 feet of it. Make
a ranged attack using your Constitution modifier + your
proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is pulled up to 15 feet
towards the object.
Find the Thing. As an action, you focus your energy through
a navigational object (such as a compass, GPS, or map).
Doing so allows you to cast the Locate Object* spell with
the following changes:
◊ The spell doesn't require you to concentrate on it.
◊ The spell's duration is 1 hour.
◊ The spell can detect an object within 1 mile of you
instead of 1,000 feet.
First Age Steed. You enact a ritual that creates a bond with
a special vehicle of your choice (such as a bicycle, moped,
or similar object you can sit on). This vehicle can only carry
one creature, has a walking speed of 60 feet, and does not
have a flying speed.
As an action, you can summon that vehicle to your side.
While summoned the vehicle is indestructible and disappears in a puff of smoke after 1 hour.
Goggled Vision. While wearing an ocular covering (such as
ski goggles, spectacles, sunglasses, or a welding mask), you
can use an action to see in dim light within 60 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades
of gray.
Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks to determine if something is an illusion.
These effects on your goggles last for 1 hour.

139

Leaping Sneakers. While wearing a pair of shoes you can
use a bonus action to add a spring to your step. For 1 hour,
you gain the benefits of the Jump* spell.
Pocket Voice. You spend 1 minute enacting a ritual that
binds your voice to an object you can see that looks as if it
would produce a sound (such as a boombox, pair of headphones, statue with a mouth, portrait of a person, radio, or
jewelry box).
Your voice stays bound to the object for 1 hour, or until
you dismiss the effect as a bonus action. While bound,
everything you say can also be heard through the object.
Water Jettison. As a bonus action, you spray a misty stream
of water from a container on your person (such as a waterskin, soda can, squirt water bottle, or spray bottle). Doing so
moves you 10 feet backwards in a straight line and grants
you the benefits of the Disengage action.

JOLT
Evocation cantrip (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
A jolt of electricity springs from your hand towards a
creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell
attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8
lightning damage.
Alternatively, you can target a machine within range and
temporarily turn it on, allowing it to function as if it were
whelmed by a spirit or permanently enchanted. Machines
targeted by this spell stay powered for 18 seconds before
turning back off. For a machine to function using this spell,
it must still be in working condition.
The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th
level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Sheep Dragon Shepherd
Monk

The sheep dragon is often regarded as the epitome of
goodness and authenticity on the island. These creatures
are dedicated to freedom and unwavering kinship. Those
shepherds living and training among the wandering sheep
dragons learn to care deeply for those around them and
understand how a flock works together to overcome obstacles. They must be ready to flee to safety yet know when
to defend their herd. The role of a sheep dragon shepherd
requires resilience, compassion, and a kind heart. Because
of this, shepherds across the island are regarded by
the people of Obojima as heroic and sometimes even
mythic figures.

Historic Past
As the tale goes, the first shepherd was a wind spirit who
went by the name Ventu. The spirit lived among the grass
and called all that grazed the central fields of Obojima their
friend, but of those creatures, none pleased Ventu more
than the playful sheep dragon. In time Ventu and the sheep
dragon became inseparable. The seasons would speed away,
and still, the pair would frolic and parade the Gale Fields
with careless glee. It's during this time that people say
Ventu gifted the sheep dragon the ability to fly and control
the winds.
One day, as Ventu explored the fields, they noticed
something unsettling in the distance. A great pillar of black
smoke split the horizon in two. Ventu rushed across the
rolling hills, only to be met by terrible disaster. A raging fire
had scorched the southern fields and slowly crawled northward. Ventu, heartbroken at the thought of what might
become of the sheep dragon just beyond the hillside, made
the heroic choice to stand against the inferno by themself.
To this day, it's unknown what became of Ventu, but the
majestic sheep dragon stands as a testament to their kindness and bravery.

Herding Sheep
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to herd your allies, calling them closer or moving them out of danger. As a bonus
action, you can spend 1 or more ki points to cause a willing
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you to move
toward you or in any other direction. This movement
doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. If the creature moves
toward you, it can move up to 15 feet per ki point spent; if it
moves in any other direction, it can move up to 10 feet per
ki point spent. A creature can’t move in this way more than
its speed would allow.
At higher levels, when you use this feature you can target
additional creatures. At 5th level you can target 2 creatures,
3 creatures at 10th, and 4 creatures at 15th.

140

Wind Shot

Take to the Skies

When you reach 6th level, you gain the ability to mimic the
sheep dragon's wind pistol, blasting enemies with powerful gale forces at a distance. When you make an unarmed
strike, you can instead choose to make a special attack, firing
a compressed blast of air from your mouth. This ranged
weapon attack has a range of 60 feet, and it uses the same
attack bonus and damage die as your unarmed strike.

By the time you reach 11th level, you’ve mastered a unique
technique that lets you glide on the wind, just like a majestic sheep dragon. When you use your Step of the Wind, you
also gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. This
flying speed lasts until the end of your turn.

Additionally, when you hit a target with this special
attack, you can choose to spend 1 ki point to force the target
to make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On
a failed save, the target is knocked prone or pushed 10 feet
away from you (your choice).

Intercepting Maneuver
Also at 6th level, your protective nature comes out in
heightened moments of skillful deflection for a nearby ally.
As a reaction, when a friendly creature within 10 feet of you
is hit by an attack, you can spend 1 ki point to reduce the
damage it takes by an amount equal
to one roll of your Martial Arts die
+ your Dexterity modifier.

Additionally, when you use your Step of the Wind, you
simultaneously take both the Disengage and Dash action.

Guide to the Herd
At 17th level, your vigilant watch of your companions while
in the midst of combat allows you to give them cues as
to when they should raise their defenses. Whenever you
use your Patient Defense to gain the benefits of the Dodge
action, you can spend 1 additional ki point to share that
benefit with your allies. Each friendly creature that can see
or hear you and is within 30 feet of you can immediately
use its reaction to also gain the benefits of the Dodge action
until the start of your next turn.

141

Tenets of the River
The tenets of the Oath of The River vary by paladin, but
all of them revolve around embracing the flow and adaptability found in water. Paladins who uphold these tenets
must understand when it is best to dispatch justice through
violence or through understanding and forgiveness. The
core principles of the tenets are:
The River Flows On. Forgiveness can be as sharp as
any blade.
The River Quenches or Drowns. Judgment is reserved
for those truly deserving of it.
The River Rages. If I must battle, I will fight with all my
passion and strength.
The River Seeks the Sea…Always. I will not abandon my
duty, especially when others are counting on me.

Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

Religious Archetypes
In Obojima, there are no deities of any sort,
which means characters like clerics and paladins
must instead draw their power from some other
sources. Alternatively, these heroic characters
draw their strength from their devotion to ideals
and the natural magic that comes from a person
who dedicates their life to their beliefs.

Oath of the River
Paladin

Those who commit themselves to the Oath of the River
have found guidance in the shifting waters and the great
creatures that live within them. These diverse individuals model their lives and the tenets they follow after the
tranquil waters of a blue pool and the rushing rapids that
spill over a great waterfall, always striving to flow around
obstacles if possible, but ready to crash through them when
left with no other option. As the river flows and bends, it
seeks the path of least resistance in its travels to the ocean.
Like the river, paladins who have sworn this oath remain
adaptable but steadfast in their own course.

Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following
two Channel Divinity options.
Rushing Rapids. As an action, you can cause a forceful
wave of water to erupt outward in a 20-foot radius centered
on you. Each Large or smaller creature of your choice in the
area must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed
5 feet outside of it.
Blessed Pool. As a bonus action, you speak gentle yet
courageous words that encourage your allies and heal them.
Choose a number of creatures up to twice your Charisma
modifier (minimum 2) that you can see within 30 feet of
you. Each creature regains 2d6 hit points.

Aura of the River
Starting at 7th level, you emanate an aura that causes the
area around you to feel as if wading into a body of water,
slowing down your enemies as they approach. The area
within 10 feet of you is considered difficult terrain for other
creatures. You can designate any number of creatures you
can see to be unaffected by it (no action required).

However this fate has befallen you, you now are both
cursed and empowered by the Corruption’s rotting, withering magic that is slowly taking you over bit by bit, replacing
your own flesh with its unearthly power.
As a corrupted being you must choose your future wisely,
it’s hard to say what this illness will manifest in you.

In addition, the first time you hit a Large or smaller
creature on your turn with a melee attack, you can use your
aura to move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space
you choose.
At 18th level, the area within 30 feet of you, instead of 10
feet, is considered difficult terrain for other creatures.

Shielding Spirit
Beginning at 15th level, whenever you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can use your reaction to halve any
damage you would take from the effect. When you do so,
you can also expend a spell slot to extend this benefit to
nearby allies. Choose a number of creatures within 10 feet
of you equal to the level of the spell slot expended; the
damage is also halved for each of those creatures.

Form of the River
Starting at 20th level, you can manifest the powerful visage
of a river spirit around your body. As a bonus action, you
gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
◊ You gain a swimming speed of 60 feet, and your walking
speed increases by 15 feet.
◊ You have advantage on all saving throws.
◊ Whenever you successfully move a creature with your
aura you can choose to deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage to it.
Once you use this bonus action, you can’t use it again
until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level
spell slot to use it again.

Corrupted Ranger
Ranger

You have become afflicted by the mysterious illness that
haunts the island known as the Corruption. This same foul
magic, which has stained the coastlines black, now resides
within your body. It curses your skin and seeps from your
pores, and in time it will even become difficult to distinguish you from it.
How this has happened is your story to tell. You may have
been one of the first responders to the Corruption when it
came to the shores of Obojima leaving you to possibly be
the only survivor of that brave band of rangers. Perhaps you
were an explorer, who stumbled on a pocket of Corruption
and became infected, or maybe you were inflicted with this
Corruption by an evil witch.

1st Manifestation
Starting at 3rd level, the Corruption within begins to manifest in combat.
Whenever you take damage, you also receive a curse
marker; if the damage was from a critical hit, you receive
two curse markers instead. These markers will remain
active until the end of your next turn, and the maximum
number of curse markers you can accumulate at a time is 2.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, all the curse
markers you have gained are instantly consumed, dealing
an extra 1d4 necrotic damage to the target for each curse
marker consumed.

143

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to call upon
your Corruption to immediately gain the maximum
number of curse markers available to you. When you
use this ability, you can’t gain more than your maximum
number of curse markers.

Alternatively, you can give your breath to another creature. Whenever a creature you can see makes a Dexterity
saving throw, you can use your reaction to give it advantage
on the saving throw and increase its speed by 15 feet until
the start of your next turn.

The number of curse markers you can accumulate at once
increases when you reach certain levels in this class: 3 at
5th level, 4 at 11th level, and 5 at 17th level.

Losing Feeling. Numbness creeps into your muscles and
bones and across your skin. The vibrancy of feeling gives
way to a broad antagonism. Your hands and arms instead
burn with a cold ethereal flame, which only you can see.
As a bonus action, you can target a creature you can see
within 60 feet of you, enveloping it with the same cursed
flames. When you deal damage with your curse markers to a
creature that has been enveloped by your flames, each curse
marker deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage, instead of 1d4.

2nd Manifestation
At 3rd level, you start to observe peculiar happenings
within your own body. At times you notice that your limbs
and torso exhibit independent movements, seemingly
acting of their own volition.
When you make a Strength or Dexterity check, you can
choose to replace the result with a number equal to 10 +
your ranger level. You can wait until after you roll the d20
before deciding to use this feature, but must decide before
the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. You can use
this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and you regain all expended
uses when you finish a long rest.

3rd Manifestation
Starting at 7th level, when you make a weapon attack against
a creature, you can expend one curse marker to roll a d4
and add it to the attack roll. You can choose to use a curse
marker in this way before or after making the attack roll. You
can expend a curse marker in this way only once per turn.
Additionally, whenever you take damage, you can use your
reaction to reduce the damage taken by an amount equal to
your ranger level. Once you reduce damage in this way, you
can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

4th Manifestation
At 11th level, your ailment is beginning to have side effects on
your body. Gain one of the following ailments of your choice.
Graying Vision. Your eyes weaken and the world around
you begins to lose some of its colorful luster. To adjust to
your slowly worsening vision, you’ve gained blindsight out
to a range of 15 feet. In addition, you automatically detect
visual illusions if their Intelligence (Investigation) check DC
is less than or equal to your ranger spell save DC.
Failing Lungs. YYour lungs have begun to ache and your
days are filled with excessive coughing. At times you feel
yourself gasping for air, and it’s in those moments you’ve
learned to steal another’s breath. As an action, you pull
your next breath from a creature you can see. The target
falls prone and can’t take reactions until the start of your
next turn. Additionally, all of your curse markers are
consumed, dealing 1d4 necrotic damage to the creature for
each marker consumed in this way.

144

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a short or long rest.

5th Manifestation
Starting at 15th level, you gain the ability to call upon the
Corruption which greatly alters your natural capabilities. As
a bonus action, you can activate this feature, doubling your
walking speed, increasing your AC by 2, and allowing you to
make two additional attacks when taking the Attack action.
In addition, all attacks are treated as if you have the maximum number of curse markers accumulated. The effects of
this feature last until the start of your next turn. You can
use this ability without negative effects once per long rest.
If you use this feature a second time before finishing a
long rest, in addition to the effects wearing off at the start
of your next turn, you also suffer one level of exhaustion
and immediately drop to 1 hit point if you have more than 1
hit point at the start of your turn.
Once you use this feature a second time, you can’t use it
again until you finish a long rest.

Waxwork Rogue
Rogue

Waxwork rogues have a long history on the island of
Obojima in dealing with the dangerous and the arcane.
They’re known for having an array of tools and tricks to
delve into the most perilous of places and almost always
coming back with treasures and tales. To a Waxwork rogue,
any challenge or danger can be solved with a bit of wax, a
pinch of smarts, and a whole lot of magic.

In the Beginning
The Courier Brigade was created to carry packages between
villages as well as guard merchant wagons through treacherous areas. But there are some areas on Obojima that are rife
with the arcane, spirit dangers, and uncanny occurrences.
Legend says that it was Lydia Starwright, Courier Brigade
First Class, who, against all advice, sought out the aid of
a powerful witch who was rumored to live within a hut
of melted wax deep within the Land of Hot Water. It was
there in that melted hut where the witch taught Lydia the
arcane practices known only to certain spirits of the island,
the ability to enchant wax and fire in wondrous ways. It
was this knowledge that transformed Lydi into the first
Waxwork Rogue.

Saving Throws. Some of your enchantments require creatures to make a saving throw to resist the enchantment’s
effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:
Enchantment save DC = 8 + your proficiency
bonus + your Intelligence or Charisma modifier
(your choice)
Wick Points. You have 3 wick points, which represent your
current ability to harness the magic from the Spirit Realm.
Manipulating the magic from another realm and pulling
its energy into an object, even one as small and simple as a
candle, can be both physically and mentally taxing. When
you spend a wick point, it is unavailable until you finish a
short or long rest, at the end of which you regain all of your
expended wick points.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you gain 1 additional wick point.

Lydia brought back this knowledge to the Courier Brigade,
and formed the Waxworks Division, a dedicated group of
arcane rogues who would volunteer for the most perilous
assignments and deliveries of the Courier Brigade.
In the present day, Waxwork rogues
have transcended the ranks of the Courier
Brigade, and their skill sets are practiced
across the island.

Conjure Flame
At 3rd level, you learn the Dancing Lights* cantrip
(the lights appear as floating candles) and the
Produce Flame* cantrip.

Wax Enchantments
When you choose this archetype at 3rd
level, you learn wax enchantments, which are
fueled by your ability to pull and manipulate magic
from the Spirit Realm. These are represented by a
number of wick points.
Enchantments. You learn three enchantments
of your choice, which are detailed under
“Enchantments” below.
You learn two additional enchantments of your
choice at 5th, 10th, and 15th level. Each time you
learn new enchantments, you can also replace one
enchantment you know with a different one.

145

Enchantments
The enchantments are presented in alphabetical order.
Blooming Light. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point
to ignite a dark green candle, which burns in a similar hue,
shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on itself.
Creatures in the candle’s light are hidden from divination
magic, and they can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived
through magical scrying sensors. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
Bocha Glue Wax. Bocha glue is a delicate mixture of the
finest waxes available and a collection of ingredients known
only to the Waxwork Rogues. When enchanted properly, it
can temporarily hold any two objects together. As an action,
you can spend 1 wick point to create an adhesive bond
between two objects using just a small amount of bocha
glue. The two objects remain bound together for 24 hours,
at which point the enchantment fades and the two objects
are separated. A creature within reach of the objects can use
an action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your
Enchantment save DC, breaking the bond early on a success.
Burning Delay (5th Level Required). You can spend 3 additional wick points to simultaneously activate Burning Delay
when you use one of the following candle enchantments:
candle pop, fish fat candle, or detonate. When you do so, you
delay that enchantment’s activation by 1 round, 1 minute, or
10 minutes (your choice).
Candle Pop. As a bonus action, you can spend 2 wick points
to ignite and hurl a misshapen yellow candle at a creature
you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a
Dexterity saving throw to avoid being partially encased in
wax as the candle explodes on impact. On a failed save, the
target is restrained by the wax. At the end of each of its
turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending
the effect on itself on a success.
Consuming Flame (10th Level Required). When you see a
hostile creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell, you can
use your reaction and spend 3 wick points to quickly ignite
the flame of a thin white candle and cast Counterspell*. If
the spell was successfully countered and was 3rd level or
lower, you can spend an additional 2 wick points to reactivate this ability and store the spell inside your candle.
While holding the candle, you can cast any spell stored
in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack
modifier, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is
otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. Once the spell has
been cast, the candle is sundered and becomes unusable. A
spell can be stored inside a candle for 24 hours, after which
the spell fades and is no longer able to be used.
Delicacy. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point to imbue
the tart flavor of a Pyramid Melon and the healing properties of a river spirit into your candle. As a bonus action,
a creature can consume the candle, causing it to regain 1d6
hit points and providing enough nourishment to sustain it

146

for one day. A candle holds this enchantment for 24 hours,
after which the properties of delicacy fade. You can have no
more than 2 candles with this enchantment at a time.
Detonate. (5th Level Required) As an action, you can spend
3 wick points to ignite and throw a dark black candle at a
point you can see within 60 feet of you. A brilliant eruption
of flame sweeps out from the candle, causing each creature
in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point to make
a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d6 fire damage
and 2d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. When you use this
enchantment, you can spend additional wick points to
increase the fire damage dealt by 1d6 for each additional
wick point spent.
The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable
objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
Fish Fat Candle. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point
to ignite and throw an oily brick of blubber candle wax that
lands in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground
within 60 feet of you. One round after the candle lands,
it emits a cloud of colorful smoke that creates a heavily
obscured area in a 20-foot radius centered on it. The candle
continues to spew smoke for 1 minute and creates a visible
trail in the sky that can be seen from 10 miles away.
Flooding Abundance. As an action, you can spend 2 wick
points to ignite and throw a tea light candle into an unoccupied space you can see on the ground within 60 feet of
you. After landing, the candle melts rapidly, bubbling and
boiling with an overwhelming amount of wax, which flows
over and fills a 15-foot-square centered on the candle. The
wax remains for 1 minute. It is flammable, and a 5-foot
square of wax exposed to fire burns away in 3 rounds, dealing 2d6 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in
the fire. All spaces covered in the wax are difficult terrain
for the duration.
Iron Seal. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point to melt
and press the wax seal of iron onto any door or object with
a lid. Once imbued with your seal, the object becomes magically shut and can’t be opened unless a creature makes a
successful Strength (Athletics) check against your Enchantment save DC, at which point the seal breaks. The iron seal
lasts until it is broken or dispelled (as if it were a 1st-level
spell). You can use an action to touch one of your iron seals
and end its effects early.
Lost Wax Carving. Using the lost form of wax carving you
craft a detailed replica of an object. When using the wax
carving technique, you can spend 2 wick points over the
course of 10 minutes to produce the effects of the Duplicate
spell. The object you duplicate can be no larger than a
1-foot cube.
Maker’s Mark. When you make an attack with a
one-handed weapon as part of the Attack action on your
turn, you can spend 1 wick point to make an unarmed strike

as part of the same action using a signet ring. This attack
deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Dexterity
modifier, plus an extra 1d6 fire damage. This attack can
benefit from your Sneak Attack, provided you haven’t
already dealt your Sneak Attack damage this turn.
You can use this enchantment once per turn.
Shielding Seal. As an action, you can spend 1 wick point
to melt and press the wax seal of shielding onto a willing
creature or object, protecting it from incoming damage. The
target of the seal gains 5 temporary hit points, which last
for 24 hours. You can grant an additional 5 temporary hit
points for each additional wick point spent, to a maximum
of 15 temporary hit points. You can only have one shielding
seal active at a time. Creating a shielding seal while another
seal of the same type is already active ends the effects of
the initial seal early.
Spark Shower. As a bonus action, you can spend 2 wick
points to bring your free hand to your mouth, igniting your
next breath. Exhaling creates a dazzling shower of sparks
aimed toward a creature within 5 feet of you. You have
advantage on the next weapon attack roll you make against
the target this turn, and the target can’t make opportunity
attacks until the end of your turn.
Waxlings. By reaching through the veil and into the Spirit
Realm, you can temporarily pull and trap a minor spirit
within a candle, granting the candle sentience. As an action,
you can spend 2 wick points to summon a waxling, casting
the Find Familiar* spell with the following changes:
◊ In place of an animal familiar, you instead imbue life into
a candle, which causes it to grow appendages and eyes.
◊ Your waxling familiar uses the statistics of a rat.
◊ You can command the familiar to use its action to touch
a flammable object that isn’t being worn or carried and
ignite it.
◊ The familiar sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 10 feet.
◊ You can’t temporarily dismiss the familiar.
◊ The familiar is dismissed permanently after 1 hour or
when it is reduced to 0 hit points.
◊ You can have more than one of these familiars at a time.
Wick Whip. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 wick points
to ignite a 10-foot length of candlewick that has been soaking in the stomach acid of a dragon frog. The flames burn at
an intense heat that warps the air around them, shedding
bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The wick burns for 1 minute, during which
you can use it as a melee weapon that you're considered
proficient with. It deals 3d4 fire damage on a hit (adding
your ability modifier to the damage roll as normal), and it
has the finesse, light, and reach properties.

Burn Cycle
Starting at 9th level, you can ignite your weapons in a flash
of hot white flames when you successfully catch an enemy
off guard. When you deal Sneak Attack damage on your
turn, you can spend wick points to deal extra fire damage
to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra
damage is 1d6 for each wick point spent, to a maximum
of 4d6.

Advanced Enchantments
When you reach 13th level, some of your enchantments
become more potent. You now use the alternate enchantments features found below. If you have yet to learn any of
the following enchantments, you may learn one as part of
this feature.
Blooming Light. Starting at 13th level, the effects of blooming light lasts for 8 hours.
Burning Delay. Starting at 13th level, you can delay the
effects of your candle enchantments by 1 round, 3 rounds, 1
minute, 10 minutes, or 1 hour.
Candle Pop. Starting at 13th level, candle pop affects the
target and each creature within 5 feet of it.
Delicacy. Starting at 13th level, the creature regains 1d12
hit points, instead of 1d6, and you can have up to 4 candles
with this enchantment at a time.
Maker’s Mark. Starting at 13th level, maker’s mark has no
limit to the number of times you can use it per turn.
Shielding Seal. Starting at 13th level, you can have up to
three shielding seals active at a time, instead of one.
Waxlings. Starting at 13th level, you can spend 3 wicks
points as an action, instead of 2, to summon two
waxlings simultaneously.

Spirit Flame
At 17th level, you learn to craft a specialty candle made of
pink wax. As a bonus action, you can ignite this candle,
which burns for 1 minute. As long as the burning candle is
on your person, you gain the following benefits:
◊ The wick point cost of your enchantments is reduced
by 1.
◊ You have immunity to fire damage.
◊ Spirits have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
If you fall prone while the burning candle is on your
person, you must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw
or the candle is extinguished early.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you
finish a long rest.

Oni Bloodline
Sorcerer

In the realm of magic, there exists a lineage of sorcerers
whose blood bears an ancient connection to the oni. These
sorcerers, known as Oni Kin, harness the magic of their
lineage to weave powerful spells. But, as they delve deeper
into their arcane abilities, they find themselves gradually
transforming, both physically and spiritually, into embodiments of the oni’s fearsome might.
At the onset of their journey and as they use their powers,
Oni Kin begin to see subtle manifestations of their lineage’s
traits—changes in appearance and temperament. However, as
they channel their magic with more skill, these traits begin
to intensify. Their skin may change, their eyes may glow with
an eerie light, and their once-subtle features become more
pronounced, bearing the unmistakable visage of an oni.
As their power reaches its zenith, Oni Kin reach a pinnacle where they can fully embrace their heritage and assume
the form of a true oni. In this form, they stand as towering
figures of terror, wielding unparalleled magical might and
physical prowess. Yet, with this transformation comes a
perilous temptation—the struggle to maintain control over
the oni ’s insatiable hunger for chaos and destruction. This
struggle is not unnoticed by islanders, most of which fear or
distrust the Oni Kin.

Arcane Prison
Trapped inside of you is the essence of the First Oni, passed
down through its children and stretched across a long and
treacherous lineage. As you grow in strength, so does the
spirit within you. It desperately wishes to bubble to the
surface, and it does so when you’re at your weakest. At 1st
level, you gain the traits of the oni, which manifest as you
expend sorcery points. Each oni trait becomes available to
you based on how many sorcery points you’re missing from
your total, represented by the table below. Regaining sorcery
points can cause you to lose one or more oni traits.
Each oni trait has both a physical and an arcane manifestation, which lasts until you finish a long rest.

Sorcery Points Missing

Manifestation

0–1

Eyes

2–4

Horns

5–9

Skin

10–14

Tongue

Hair

148

Oni Traits
Eyes. Your eyes shimmer with an almost mesmerizing
quality. As an action, you can activate your innate ocular
charm. For 1 minute, you have advantage on all Charisma
checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn’t
hostile toward you, provided it can see your eyes. When the
effect ends, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw
against your spell save DC. On a success, the target realizes
that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes
hostile toward you. A creature prone to violence might
attack you. Another creature might seek retribution in other
ways (at the GM’s discretion), depending on the nature of
your interaction with it.
Horns. You gain horns which rapidly grow and jut out from
your head. When casting a cantrip that requires you to
make a melee or ranged spell attack, you can instead make
a melee spell attack using your horns, channeling the spell
through them. When you hit a creature with a cantrip cast
in this way, the target takes an extra 1d6 piercing damage.

Additionally, when a hostile creature’s movement
provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your
reaction to cast a cantrip at the creature using your horns
rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell
must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only
that creature.
Skin. The hue of your skin turns to a dull red, green, or blue
color and you adopt the regenerative powers of the oni.
Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you regain
a number of hit points equal to the spell’s level + your
Constitution modifier. You don’t gain this benefit if you
activate the Tongue trait for that casting.
Tongue. With every incantation cast, the twisted and
demonic voice of the First Oni can be heard within your
speech. When you cast a spell that requires a verbal component and targets a single creature, you can also use your
bonus action to cause the target to recoil in fear. The target
must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save
DC. On a failed save, the target must use its reaction, if
available, to move up to half its speed away from you or fall
prone (your choice).
Hair. Your hair turns a shocking white and stretches
towards the ground as it grows to cover your back. You gain
a +2 bonus to your AC.

Ogre Manipulation
Starting at 6th level, you can manifest one of your oni traits,
regardless of how many sorcery points you’re missing. As a
bonus action, you can gain one of the oni traits you could
normally obtain through the expenditure of sorcery points
and draw it out early. This trait lasts for 1 minute, and you
lose it if you haven’t gained the trait by normal means in
that time.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

Boiling Power
At 14th level, your oni traits grow in strength. The following
changes apply to your traits:
Eyes. In addition to the benefits you normally have, you
learn the Zone of Truth* spell, which you can cast without
expending a spell slot. When you cast it, only one creature
of your choice within 60 feet of you is affected by the spell.
The target must make its saving throw against the spell
at the start of each of its turns, provided it can see your
eyes; the spell ends early if the target can no longer see
your eyes.
Horns. The extra damage dealt by your horns increases
to 1d12.
Skin. Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you
now regain a number of hit points equal to twice the spell’s
level + your Constitution modifier.
Tongue. When you activate the Tongue trait using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, in place of the trait’s normal
effects, you can instead cause the target to tremble in
fear, becoming hyper fixated on you. The target’s passive
Wisdom (Perception) score is reduced to 5 and it takes a −5
penalty to its AC against all attacks that aren’t made by you.
This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

Transformation
Beginning at 18th level, you can fully embody the fabled
visage of your demon ancestor without needing to exhaust
your sorcerous power. As an action, you can instantly manifest all of your oni traits, regardless of how many sorcery
points you’re missing. While manifesting your oni traits in
this way, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, and you can’t be
charmed or frightened.
This effect lasts for 1 minute, after which you lose any trait
you haven’t gained by normal means in that time. Once you
use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long
rest, unless you spend 5 sorcery points to use it again.

149

The Lantern

Spells

Warlock

Warlocks who make a pact with a powerful spirit are able
to tap into the magic that flows through the Spirit Realm.
These warlocks are known by the special lanterns they
carry—lanterns that burn with the essence of their patron.
The illumination of this vessel carries with it the attributes
of the spirit, granting the warlock an array of abilities.
When spirits enter pacts with people, there is often more
to it than generosity. Spirits powerful enough to lend out
bits of their magic do so for a variety of reasons. Perhaps
the spirit is beholden to do so due to a bargain or curse. It
could be that the spirit needs allies (though they might not
readily admit it). Or maybe they simply see something in
you that amuses them. The things that motivate spirits are
as varied as they are. And truly powerful spirits can
be inscrutable.

Faerie Fire*, Identify*

Create Spirit Train Stop, Tamh Gon’s Fiery
Festival Feast

Illuminating Aura
Starting at 1st level, the essence of your spirit patron is
channeled into a lantern, where it appears as a minor form
of itself. You can use your lantern as a spellcasting focus for
your warlock spells.
As a bonus action, you can activate your lantern, causing
it to shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for
an additional 20 feet. This light lasts for 1 minute, or until
you let go of the lantern or choose to end this effect
early (no action required). For the duration, you gain the
following benefits:
◊ Whenever you see a creature in your lantern’s bright light
make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to grant
that creature a bonus to the save equal to your Charisma
modifier (minimum of +1).
◊ Whenever a hostile creature within your lantern’s dim
light fails a saving throw, it takes radiant damage equal to
half your warlock level (rounded up).
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

Revealing Light
Starting at 1st level, you can use an action to cause your
lantern to illuminate with a vibrant maroon light, which
sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 10 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible
as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. The lantern
sheds light in this manner for 1 hour or until you snuff it
out early as a bonus action.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

150

Dangerous Tool

Brighter Still

Starting at 6th level, your Illuminating Aura no longer ends
if you let go of your lantern. While you aren’t holding your
lantern, you can magically take control of it for 1 minute (no
action required), using it as if it were a Spiritual Weapon*
cast as a 2nd-level spell. Your lantern continues to act
as your spellcasting focus while using this feature, even
though you are no longer holding the lantern.

At 14th level, you gain the ability to activate your lantern’s
Illuminating Aura at will. Features such as Dangerous Tool
and Brilliant Illumination that work in conjunction with
Illuminating Aura are still limited to the number of uses
described in their respective features.

The level at which Spiritual Weapon* is cast increases
when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to
a 4th-level spell at 10th level and a 6th-level spell at
15th level.

Additionally, while holding your lantern, you can use an
action to cause it to illuminate with a pale blue light, revealing a glowing arcane path to a location you’re familiar with,
as if casting the Find the Path* spell.
Once you use your lantern in this way, you can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest.

Once you take control of your lantern in this way, you
can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you
expend a warlock spell slot to take control of it again.

Oracle Illumination
Beginning at 6th level, you can spend an action to magically connect your mind to a light source such as a candle
or torch that you can see or are familiar with. The light
source acts as if it were the sensor created by the Clairvoyance* spell, granting you the same benefits. You can use the
light source in this way for 10 minutes or until you use this
feature again.
Once you use this feature on a light source, you can’t use
it on the same light source again until you finish a long rest.

Brilliant Illumination
Starting at 10th level, while your lantern’s Illuminating
Aura is active you can use an action to cause the light to
flare with an overwhelmingly brilliant flash. Each creature
other than you illuminated by either your lantern’s bright
light or dim light (your choice) must make a Constitution
saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed
save, a creature takes radiant damage equal to 2d8 + your
warlock level and is blinded until the end of your next
turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and isn’t blinded.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

151

Origami Mage
Wizard

Origami Mages are wielders of a unique form of magic that
combines precision, creativity, and imagination. With a flick
of their wrist and a whisper of arcane words, they transform
simple sheets of paper into awe-inspiring manifestations of
elemental forces, mystical beings, and fantastical creatures.
Drawing inspiration from the mysterious elegance of
origami, these mages are not bound by traditional spell
components but instead rely on the meticulous manipulation of paper to channel their magical energies. Origami
magic is not without its challenges. Mastery of this arcane
discipline demands patience, dexterity, and a keen eye for
detail. Each fold must be precise, each crease exact, for even
the smallest imperfection can disrupt the flow of magic and
render a spell ineffective. Yet, for those who persevere, the
rewards are boundless.

An Arcane Art
At 2nd level, you learn to weave magic into origami, allowing you to create magnificent moving art pieces, which act
on your behalf. As a bonus action, you can fold and imbue
life into a paper construct that takes a form you choose
from the list below. When crafted, an origami construct
becomes bound to you or another creature of your choice
that you can see within 60 feet of you.
A creature with a bound origami construct gains the
unique effects and features listed for that construct. A
creature can’t have more than one of the same origami
construct bound to it at a time, unless stated otherwise.
A bound construct occupies the same space as the creature
it’s bound to.
These constructs stay imbued with life for a number of
hours equal to half your wizard level. Origami constructs
have an AC equal to your spell save DC, are immune to
poison and psychic damage, and are destroyed when they
take any damage. You can use this feature to create an
origami construct a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

Origami Constructs
The constructs are presented in alphabetical order.
Bird. While the origami bird is bound to your person, you
gain proficiency in the Perception skill. Additionally, you
deal an additional 2 slashing damage whenever you hit a
target with a ranged attack.
Cat. While the origami cat is bound to your person, you
gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. Additionally, once
on each of your turns when you hit a target with a melee
weapon attack, the origami cat can make a melee spell
attack against the same target. Its attack modifier is equal to
your weapon attack modifier, and on a hit, the target takes
1d6 slashing damage.
The origami cat’s damage increases when you reach
certain levels in this class: 1d8 at 5th level, 1d10 at 11th
level, and 1d12 at 17th level.
Crab. While the origami crab is bound to your person, you
gain a +1 bonus to your AC and proficiency in the Athletics skill. If the wizard that crafted this origami crab creates
another, this origami crab is destroyed.
Dragon. While the origami dragon is bound to your person,
you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and
can’t benefit from being invisible. Additionally, you take 1d4
fire damage at the start of each of your turns. You can have
multiple origami dragons bound to you at the same time.
When the construct is destroyed, it quickly pops in an
audible explosion, dealing 2d6 fire damage to each creature
within 5 feet of it.

152

Frog. While the origami frog is bound to your person, you
gain proficiency in the Acrobatics skill. As a reaction, when
you would fail a Dexterity saving throw, you can add a
bonus to the roll equal to the spellcasting ability modifier
of the wizard that crafted the construct; using this feature
destroys the origami frog.

Origami Familiar

Origami Servant
Beginning at 10th level, you learn the Unseen Servant*
spell; you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count
against the number of spells you can prepare each day. In
addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot, but
the maximum number of servants you can have at a time is
equal to half your wizard level (rounded up). When you cast
it, it has the following changes:

At 2nd level, you learn the Find Familiar* spell; you always
have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of
spells you can prepare each day. Your familiar appears as an
origami version of itself, is immune to poison and psychic
damage, and is a construct, instead of a celestial, fey, or
fiend. In addition to the familiar’s normal statistics, it also
gains access to the following abilities.

◊ The spell lasts for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus, instead of 1 hour.

Camouflage. You can command your familiar to shift
into a flattened paper form. In this form the familiar
looks nearly indistinguishable from a normal piece
of paper. If a creature uses its action to examine the
familiar, it can discern the familiar for what it is with a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. The familiar can use an action to shift
back into its origami form.

◊ When you use your bonus action to command a servant,
you can issue a unique command to each servant you
have created as part of the same bonus action.

Last Resort. As an action, your origami familiar can
dive toward a creature, unfurling itself and wrapping
around the target’s face, as if a sheet of paper blown
by the wind. The target must make a Dexterity saving
throw against your spell save DC or become blinded for 1
minute. A creature blinded by the paper or one that can
touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC. On a success, the
target is no longer blinded. When this effect ends, your
familiar is destroyed.

◊ As an action, while your servant is within 100 feet of you,
you can see through your servant’s eyes and hear what
it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the
benefits of any special senses that the servant has.
During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to
your own senses.

Reconnaissance. As an action, you can command your
familiar to spy. The origami familiar will then spend 1
minute listening to any and all sounds within 15 feet of
itself, recording what is overhears on its paper body. It
then returns to you and dispels its familiar form, leaving
behind a transcript of its findings written in a language
of your choice that you know.

◊ Your servant appears as a visible origami version of itself.
◊ Your servant is immune to poison and psychic damage.
◊ Your servant can move through a space as narrow as 1
inch wide without squeezing.

◊ Your servant falls at a rate of 60 feet per round and takes
no falling damage.
◊ Your servant can see invisible creatures and objects as if
they were visible.

Arcane Refresh
At 14th level, your origami constructs return the magic you
lent them when you imbued them with life whenever they
are destroyed. When one of your constructs is destroyed,
you can regain 10 hit points or regain a spell slot of 2nd
level or lower (your choice).
Additionally, when one of your constructs would take
damage, you can use your reaction to negate the damage
against it. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again
until you finish a long rest.

Binding Release
Starting at 6th level, you can use a bonus action to move
one of your origami constructs to a creature that you can
see within 30 feet of it.

Paper Path
Also at 6th level, when you cast a spell with a range of
touch, your origami construct can deliver the spell as if it
had cast the spell. Your construct must be within 100 feet of
you. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack
modifier for the roll.

BACKGROUNDS
This section describes backgrounds that are unique to Obojima. Many of them are associated with one of the factions
outlined on page 17. Feel free to use the ones found in the Player’s Handbook, and consider how they might fit into
the setting.

Apprentice of
AHA
You spent time studying
with the archaeologists,
historians, and archivists of
AHA, the group of adventuring academics who
seek knowledge about the
nature of Obojima and its past. With your mentor, you
pursued answers to one of the island’s mysteries. During
your apprenticeship, you traveled to one or more of AHA’s
excavation sites and worked alongside the organization, but
never became an official member. Even now, unanswered
questions from your time with the group continue to rattle
around in your mind. For more on AHA, see page 17.
Skill Proficiencies: History, Investigation
Tool Proficiencies: You gain proficiency in an Artisan’s
Tool of your choice.
Equipment: An Explorer’s Pack, 5 candles, shovel, signal
whistle, a journal full of old research from your time as an
apprentice, and 13 gold flowers.

FEATURE: WISE REPUTATION
Due to your time spent in the field you’ve met or are familiar with many of the intellectuals and creative minds in
Obojima’s villages.

Apprentice Diver
You are or once were a
member of the Mariners’
Guild, an intrepid group of
aquatic explorers and mariners. Working as an apprentice
diver in the lodge you have
learned much about the Shallows—you know what is dangerous and what is delicious.
You have climbed the cliffs around the island, explored
many beaches, and learned how to use the gear needed to
survive under the waves. For more on the Mariners’ Guild,
see page 17.
Skill Proficiencies: Athletics, Nature
Tool Proficiencies: Divers Armor
Equipment: An Explorer’s Pack, a chest, grappling hook,

154

fishing tackle, a faction coin marking which lodge you
trained under, and 11 gold flowers.

FEATURE: ONCE A MEMBER ALWAYS
A MEMBER
When visiting either of the Coastal Diver’s Lodges, you
always have free room and board. Additionally, the lodge
will assist you in your endeavors as best they can.

Apprentice
Witch
The ways of witchery
are mysterious and often
guarded by its practitioners.
Whether you sought it
out or a witch recognized something in you, you came to
apprentice for a witch or coven. Under their tutelage, you
were introduced to Obojima’s folk magic tradition, where
you learned the rudiments of potions and other magical
preparations. Although you may have trained under one for
some time, you never officially joined one of the covens and
are considered a witch without a crest. For more on witch
covens, see page 19.
Skill Proficiencies: Arcana, Survival
Tool Proficiencies: Alchemist’s supplies
Equipment: Alchemist's supplies, 9 common ingredients
(which you know the attributes for), a hat or robe from your
time as an apprentice, and 9 gold flowers.

FEATURE: SIBLING STUDENT
You have a close and trustworthy friend who studied under
the same witch as you and has now made it into one of the
six main covens. When needed, they act as your liaison to
the coven or covens they’re connected to.
If a player chooses an apprentice background
for their character, it doesn’t mean they are full
members of that faction. An apprentice witch,
for example, learned under a witch for a time,
but it doesn’t mean that character was inducted
into a coven yet. It does mean that the apprentice
had a mentor, though. Work with that player to
figure out who their character’s mentor or mentors were, and determine what that character’s
current level of involvement is with that faction.

Courier
Brigade Cadet

Spirit Kin

Skill Proficiencies: Stealth, Survival

Though everyone living on
Obojima comes in contact
with spirits to one degree
or another, your interaction with the Spirit Realm
has always occurred with
peculiar regularity. All
your life you’ve had a special kinship with spirits that few
share in. You’ve come to love their food, their culture, and
their people more than the average material being. These
habits have drawn fascination, suspicion, and confusion
from locals, but that doesn’t stop them from enlisting your
talents when spirit stuff gets weird.

Tool Proficiencies: Cobbler’s tools

Skill Proficiencies: Mechanics, Persuasion

Equipment: An Explorer’s Pack, cobbler’s tools, climber's kit, hooded lantern, lock, an old uniform issued by the
courier brigade, and 11 gold flowers.

Languages: Torum

You were a cadet with the
noble Courier Brigade, where
you trained at arms, learned
to traverse the landscape
quickly and quietly, and
practiced the hallowed task of properly delivering a package.
The couriers’ code—“Deliverance through delivery”—taught
you that your purpose is to be of service to others, and that
one of the highest virtues is seeing things through to the
end. For more on the Courier Brigade, see page 17.

FEATURE: POCKET MAP
You have an old worn out pocket map of the island from
your time as a cadet. The map is inscribed with a handful of
paths known only to the Courier Brigade.

Mechanic
You’ve spent most of your
life working on mechanisms
and machines. For you,
understanding both new
and old technology requires a more hands on approach.
Through trial and error, you have learned to create, repair,
and modify all things mechanical and electronic, and you
have honed your eye to recognize useful parts among
the scattered bits of technology that are found throughout
the island.

Equipment: A bedroll, 10 candles, two different common
ingredients (linked to your spirit allies), a special item gifted
to you by a spirit, and 10 gold flowers.

FEATURE: CONNECTIONS BEYOND
MATERIAL
You have come to know two spirits by name, and through
your relationship have learned special rituals and techniques that allow you to find them across the Physical and
Spirit Realms.
By using two unique ingredients that you choose when
taking this background, you can contact these spirits from
any distance or plane of existence. The ritual you enact to
utilize these ingredients and contact a spirit is uniquely
your own—it might involve a tea ceremony, or perhaps the
burning of the ingredients and partaking in the aromatic
smoke they produce.

Skill Proficiencies: Mechanics, Salvage
Tool Proficiencies: You gain proficiency in three Artisan’s
Tools of your choice.
Equipment: An abacus, ball bearings (1000), block and
tackle, flask of oil, an unfinished mechanical trinket, and 15
gold flowers.

FEATURE: MACHINE WHISPERER
You have a knack for machines and can tell what state one
is in by spending a few minutes with it. Machines that
have been sundered are unusable and should be scrapped
for parts. Machines in disrepair could potentially function
again if someone fixed them up, and functioning machines
do just that. Function!

LANGUAGES
The languages spoken on Obojima all sound different because each language has its own mysterious origin. The croaking
language of the Nakudama is very different from the whispered language of the spirits. There are various dialects that
have developed among the human villages around the island that sound similar having had a common ancestry, but the
language of humans and elves compared to that of the dara or the Nakudama are as different as night and day.
Over time, Obojimans have developed their own common tongue which allows everyone to converse, trade, tell tales,
and poke fun at one another.

TORUM (SPIRIT LANGUAGE)

COMMON

EQUIPMENT
Obojimans are known for their ability to find a use for everything and the island has all kinds of odd tools and contraptions from every era of its long and mysterious history. Thus, when an adventurer goes to outfit themselves for their
journey, there might be all kinds of interesting tools, weapons, and exotic merchandise for them to peruse before choosing
what equipment will best suit the needs of their quest.

Armor
Bark Armor. While wearing bark armor, you gain advantage on stealth checks made in wooded areas.
Divers Armor. While wearing divers armor your movement is reduced by 10, unless your Strength score is equal
to or greater than 18. Additionally, whenever the spell
Water Breathing* is cast on you while wearing the divers
armor, the duration of the spell is doubled for you.

DIVERS
ARMOR

Pot Lid. When taking the attack action with a finesse or
light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you
can use a bonus action to attack with a pot lid that you’re
holding in the other hand. On a hit, the pot lid deals 1d4
bludgeoning damage. You don’t add your ability modifier to
the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier
is negative.

Shield Mechanics
This optional rule allows shield bearers to sacrifice their shield in order to reduce damage from
an incoming attack. In this rule system, non-magical shields have their own set of hit points,
which you can use in place of yours when the moment calls for it. When a creature wielding a
shield is hit by an attack, it can use its reaction to direct damage from the incoming attack to
the shield’s pool of hit points, instead of taking the damage itself. If the shield is reduced to
0 hit points, it is broken, and any excess damage is dealt to the creature wielding the shield
as normal. A broken shield gives no bonus to the shield bearer’s AC.
POT LID

A shield’s durability is based on the material it’s made of.
Below is a list of example shields.

Shield Durability Table

If a shield takes damage or is broken, it can be repaired at
any armorsmith at a cost of 1 gold petal for each hit point

When a shield is damaged in this way, it is

artisan’s tools, or the Mending* spell. Instead, to
return the shield to its original condition it must
be taken to a shop and repaired by a craftsman.

Island Weapons
Weapons unique to Obojima are described here.
Bellow Flute. The traditional Obojiman instrument has
gotten a second life as a swift club-like weapon commonly
used by traveling performers. It is crafted from a special
coral found all across the shallows, which naturally forms
with dozens of tiny holes that run throughout the body of
the instrumental weapon. When swung it emits a beautiful
harmonic sound.
Dandelion Spear. This strange and intimidating weapon
was made for fishing in the reefs and crags of the Shallows.
Its long haft is tipped with a spherical array of thin sharp
barbs, which gave the spear its title, as its silhouette is
reminiscent of a blooming dandelion.

Field Spear. Also known as the merchant's blade, the field
spear was proven a useful and sturdy tool by the hundreds
of merchants and travelers that use it in their expeditions
across the island. Its shorter haft is roughly half the size of
a standard spear and its tip is more similar to a wide blade
or dagger than the traditional spear tip.
Lom Lom Dagger. The short and angular blade of a lom
lom dagger was designed for cleaving and quickly became a
staple in most of Obojima's kitchens. Over time, the blade
length grew longer and longer, and eventually the lom lom
dagger made its way out of the kitchen and into the hands
of adventurers, who favored it for its balance and accuracy
when thrown.

159

VERTEBRAE
SWORD

Nakudama
BUBBLE ROD

FRYING
PAN

FAN

UMBRELLA
SECRET
STONE SWORD

Nakudama Bubble Rod. The Nakudama bubble rod is
most recognizable by the curious sounds it produces when
used. The wet descending whistle of multiple water filled
glass marbles shot from the end of the oblong tube, quickly
followed by the unmistakable pop of the ammunition as
they hit their target.

While wielding a candlemaker’s club, you can use a bonus
action to extinguish a flame within 5 feet of you.

Secret Stone Sword. Although it's not much of a secret nowadays, the magical stone known as feather rock, which is used
to craft these stone swords, was once coveted and kept hidden
by the Nakudama. Even though feather rock is now commonly
used by potion brewers, and the craft of making one of these
swords is fairly common, the name has stayed the same.

Frying Pan. When wielding a frying pan, you can use
your bonus action to add a +1 bonus to your AC until the
end of your next turn. You can’t gain this benefit while
wielding a shield.

Tapper Sack. A tapper sack is a simple tool and weapon
used by farmers. At the end of a fine, yet sturdy, braided
cord is a simple bag which has been filled with sand.
Although it's not very flashy, in the hands of a skilled
adventurer this humble weapon packs quite a punch.

Special Weapons
Weapons with special rules are described here.
Boomerang. When thrown, the boomerang returns to an
unoccupied space adjacent to you. As a reaction, you can
choose to catch it.
Butterfly Staff. Although it can be used as a weapon, the
butterfly staff is more commonly used as a tool to catch small
spirits and critters. Its tall haft is capped with a well-woven
net, which is often made from sheep dragon wool.
When you make a grapple check while holding the butterfly staff, you can use the staff to target a Small or smaller
creature that is up to 10 feet away from you. When you do so,
you use your attack modifier for the weapon in place of your
Strength (Athletics) check. While grappling a creature in this
way, you can’t make another attack with the butterfly staff.
Candlemaker’s Club. These heavy honey dipper shaped
clubs are traditionally used for mixing the giant vats of
wax used by the Courier Brigade to seal packages and craft
candles. They’re now used by postal knights and adventurers as a useful defensive and offensive tool.

160

Fan. When you’re hit by a ranged weapon attack, you can
use your reaction to reduce the incoming damage of the
attack by a number equal to your Dexterity modifier.

Shepherd Crook. As a bonus action, you can make a
contested Strength check against a creature within range,
moving the target to another unoccupied space within 5
feet of you on a success.
Umbrella. Whenever you take falling damage while wielding an umbrella, you can use your reaction to reduce the
damage by a number equal to twice your proficiency bonus.
Vertebrae Sword. The jagged vertebrae sword of a fishfolk
warrior can barely be called a sword. Locals would say it’s
better described as a makeshift weapon crafted from a fish
skeleton and sea trash. Its poor construction is the reason
it's not often a weapon seen on land, though when used by
a skilled fighter, it most certainly can be a formidable tool.
When you successfully hit a creature with a vertebrae
sword, you can use a bonus action to rake and twist the
weapon, breaking off some of the sword's boney barbs and
dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage. The vertebrae sword
can only be used in this way 5 times before it becomes
unusable as a weapon.
Vaulter’s Axe. The vaulter’s axe was designed by the Rangers
of the Greenward Path for exploring the Brackwater Wetlands.
Its tall haft allows wielders of the axe to easily check water
depths and vault over obstacles. To this day it's a useful tool
for anyone exploring the eastern side of the island.
As part of your movement, you can use the vaulter's axe to
launch yourself 15 feet over a creature or obstacle. Using your
movement in this way ignores nonmagical difficult terrain.

ADVENTURING GEAR
Below you’ll find an array of nonmagical objects and equipment commonly used by the islanders. This list includes
First Age technology, recreations of First Age technology, and new creations.

Arcane Detection Kit. Arcane Detection Kits (or ADKs)
have been popularized by witches in the last two decades
as the desire for potions from local islanders has gradually
increased. Although the contents of these kits vary depending on the coven and individual using them, there are a few
staples found in nearly every kit, such as spark powder and
arcana oil. No matter the contents, a skilled potion brewer
can use the kit to sniff out the latent magic found in objects
all across the island.
Bicycle. These First Age vehicles have become increasingly
popular over the years as recreations started being crafted
out of Yatamon. Both the recreations and the originals have
a speed of 60 feet while being ridden.
Sea Sink Boots. These weighted boots are used by the
Mariners’ Guild to quickly descend into the Shallows and
explore the shallow beds. While wearing the boots, all
nonmagical speeds you possess are reduced to 10 feet, you
descend into water at a rate of 100 feet per round, and you
can walk across the ocean floor as if you weren't buoyant.

Glider. A creature holding onto a glider with both hands
while falling, descends at a rate of 10 feet per round and
can travel up to 50 feet horizontally. A creature can use its
action to operate the glider, changing the direction they’re
moving and avoiding any obstacles in their path. If a creature is still in the air after 1 minute has passed, it must
succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or let go of the
glider, falling as it normally would. This saving throw is
repeated every minute, with the DC increasing by 2 every
time the saving throw is made (to a maximum of DC 20).
Hook Sling. This heavy metal contraption can be used to
hurl a barbed hook at the surface of a solid object within
20 feet of you, latching onto it and pulling you toward
the target. The hook can be hurled using a bonus action,
and it requires an action to wind it back in before you can
use it again. You can hurl the hook using only one hand,
but it requires two hands to wind the hook back in. If the
targeted surface has no lip to grasp or is otherwise too
difficult for the barb to hook onto, the hook fails to latch
onto it and pull you.

161

FEATS
Feats are a way to customize and enhance your character without increasing ability scores—an option that your GM can
choose to include in your game. These feats are filled with flavor designed to make your character feel more a part of the
world of Obojima.

Boomerang Expert

Cloud Hopper

You have mastered the versatile boomerang and are capable
of performing extraordinary feats with the weapon. You gain
the following benefits:

Your exposure to the great wind spirit has changed you. You
gain the following benefits:

◊ The damage die for the boomerang is now a d8 for you.
◊ Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on
ranged attack rolls made with a boomerang.
◊ You automatically catch the boomerang after throwing it
without needing to use your reaction.

Bumbling Fool
You have a peculiar way of fumbling through life that somehow always works out in your favor, succeeding in situations
through what others might view as accidental luck. When
you fail an ability check and roll a number on the die equal
to half your level (rounded up) or lower, you can choose to
replace the die roll with a 15 instead. You can use this ability
three times, and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

Canden and Moon’s Master Cut
Prerequisite: You must have beaten a master at Master Canden
and Moon’s Sword School
Having trained with the masters of the first sword school
of Obojima, you’ve picked up a handful of useful skills. You
gain the following benefits:
◊ Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.
◊ Immediately after rolling initiative, you can use your reaction before the first turn of combat to draw a weapon and
move up to half your speed (rounded up). If you end this
movement within reach of another creature, you can use
the weapon to make one melee attack against that creature.
◊ When you are hit by an attack, you can use a reaction to
assume a defensive stance, allowing you to fend off incoming strikes. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5
bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. Once
you assume this stance, you can’t do so again until you
finish a long rest.

◊ When you move on your turn, you can choose to conjure
tiny clouds below your feet, allowing you to move into
unoccupied spaces in the air. You can move a number of
feet in this way equal to 5 × your proficiency bonus before
the clouds stop appearing. Ending this movement while
in the air causes you to fall as normal.
◊ You learn the Fog Cloud* and Gust of Wind* spells, each
of which you can cast once without expending a spell
slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this
way when you finish a long rest. You can also cast the
spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.
Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence,
Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice).

Coven Witch
Prerequisite: You must be a member of a witches coven
You have become an official member of a witches coven.
You gain the following benefits:
◊ Increase your Intelligence or Wisdom score by 1, to a
maximum of 20.
◊ You learn two random common and uncommon potion
recipes from your coven.
◊ You learn two 1st-level spells of your choice. The 1st-level
spells must be from the divination, conjuration, or transmutation school of magic. You can cast each of these
spells once without expending a spell slot. You regain
the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you
finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using
spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’
spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

Forager
You’ve spent countless hours exploring the island searching
for ingredients. You gain the following benefits:
◊ Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
◊ You gain proficiency in the Survival skill. If you already
have this proficiency, you instead gain expertise with that

162

skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for
any ability check you make using it.

which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make with it.

◊ You produce twice the number of common or uncommon
ingredients when foraging.

◊ When you succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
to steal something, you can magically turn the object you
stole invisible as part of the same action, as if you had
cast the Obscure Object spell. The object must be small
enough to fit in the palm of your hand, and this effect
lasts for 1 minute. You can use this ability a number of
times per day equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Freediver
You have undergone extensive underwater training. You
gain the following benefits:
◊ Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum
of 20.
◊ You gain a swimming speed equal to twice your Constitution score (rounded up to the nearest 5 feet). If you
already have a swimming speed, it instead increases by
10 feet.
◊ You triple your Constitution modifier when calculating
how long you can hold your breath.
◊ You gain resistance to cold damage.

Group Combatant
You’ve honed your fighting skills and are just as comfortable
fighting a group of enemies as you are facing a combatant
one on one. You gain the following benefits:
◊ Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage that you take
from nonmagical attacks is reduced by 2, to a minimum
of 1.
◊ Creatures don’t gain advantage on attacks made against
you using the optional flanking rules.
◊ After you provoke an opportunity attack on your turn,
your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for
the rest of the turn.

Light Foot
You are exceptionally speedy and agile. You gain the following benefits:
◊ While you aren’t wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1
bonus to your AC.
◊ Whenever you take the Attack action, you can forgo one
of your attacks to move up to half your speed.
◊ Nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no
extra movement.
◊ You can move through a hostile creature's space, regardless of its size.

Magically Mischievous

Member of AHA
Prerequisite: You must be a member of AHA
You have become an official member of AHA. You gain the
following benefits:
◊ Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
◊ You learn the Jolt cantrip. You also learn one of the
following spells of your choice: Comprehend Languages*,
Detect Magic*, Identify*, or Illusory Script*. You can
cast the chosen spell once without expending a spell slot,
and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in
this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell
slots you have. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.

Minor Corruption
You were exposed to the Corruption, a dark magic that's
poisoning the island. It’s now begun to alter you as well.
You gain the following benefits:
◊ You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you have less than half
of your hit points remaining.
◊ You can draw upon the Corruption within you to channel
your magical power. You don’t need to use a spellcasting
focus for your spells, allowing you to ignore the material
components specified for the spell, unless the component
indicates a cost or is consumed by the spell.
◊ As a reaction, when you take damage, you can temporarily negate an amount of the damage equal to three times
your level; you take any excess damage as normal. At the
end of your next turn, you must make a Constitution
saving throw, the DC of which is equal to 10 or one-third
the damage you would have taken, whichever number
is higher. On a failed save, you immediately take the
negated damage. You must continue to make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of your turns for 1
minute or until you fail the save, at which point you take
the negated damage. Once you take this reaction, you
can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

You’ve picked up a few magical tricks that assist your nefarious skills. You gain the following benefits:
◊ You gain proficiency in the Sleight of Hand skill. If you
already have proficiency, you gain expertise instead,

163

Nakudama’s Electric Bloodline

Potion Brewer

Prerequisite: You must be a Nakudama

Your expertise and understanding of magical potions and
elixirs allow you to finesse ingredients and recipes to your
specifications. You gain the following benefits:

Although it's uncommon in today's day and age, some
Nakudama are able to awaken the now dormant skills held
by their warring ancestors. You gain the following benefits:
◊ You have resistance to lightning damage.
◊ You have an electrified tongue that you can use to make
unarmed strikes. It has the finesse and reach properties, and when you hit with it, the strike deals lightning
damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an
unarmed strike. The damage from your tongue increases
when you reach 5th level (1d8), 11th level (1d10), and 17th
level (1d12).
◊ When you become grappled by a creature, you can use
your reaction to force the creature to make a Constitution
saving throw (DC 8 + your Constitution modifier + your
proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes
1d10 lightning damage and the grapple ends.

Nakudama’s Toxin Bloodline
Prerequisite: You must be a Nakudama
Although it's uncommon in today's day and age, some
Nakudama are able to awaken the now dormant skills held
by their warring ancestors. You gain the following benefits:
◊ You have resistance to poison damage.
◊ You have advantage on saving throws against
being poisoned.
◊ You can cause your cheeks to swell and bubble out as
your mouth fills with liquid poison. As an action, you can
spit several globs of poison in quick succession, targeting
a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus.
Each target must be within 30 feet of you and must make
a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Constitution
modifier + your proficiency bonus). A target takes poison
damage equal to 1d8 + your proficiency bonus on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Postal Knight
Prerequisite: You must be a member of the Courier Brigade
You have trained as a member of the Courier Brigade. You
gain the following benefits:
◊ Increase your Constitution or Wisdom score by 1, to a
maximum of 20.
◊ You gain proficiency in the Athletics and Survival skills.
◊ Exhaustion doesn't cause you to have disadvantage on
ability checks.

164

◊ When brewing potions, you can choose to take the
second-highest ingredient attribute number from your
potion recipe, instead of the first.
◊ When brewing a potion, you can roll percentile dice. If
you roll a number equal to or lower than your level, you
create two potions instead of one.

Tellu and Scale’s Master Cut
Prerequisite: You must have beaten a master at Master Tellu and
Scale’s Sword School
Having trained with the masters of the valley sword school,
you have learned the usefulness of quickly changing
between different fighting techniques in the midst of battle.
You gain the following benefits:
◊ One Handed. While wielding a versatile weapon in one
hand, your quick movements and agile defense allow you
to regain ground even when your enemy advances. Once
before the start of your next turn when you’re missed
by a melee attack from a creature within your reach, the
attacker takes damage from your weapon equal to twice
your proficiency bonus.
◊ Two Handed. When wielding a versatile weapon in two
hands, your powerful stance allows you to catch your
target off guard. Whenever an enemy within your reach
makes a melee weapon attack against you and misses, you
can use your reaction to attempt to knock the attacker off
balance. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw (DC 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency
bonus) or be knocked prone.

Toraf and Bolder’s Master Cut
Prerequisite: You must have beaten a master at Master Toraf and
Bolder’s Sword School
Having trained with the masters of the mountain sword
school, you’ve learned how to pull off difficult weapon
maneuvers which allow you to target specific parts of a
creature's anatomy. You gain the following benefits:
◊ Head Strike. Before you make a melee attack with a
weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to
take a −5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, the
target has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes
before the end of its next turn.
◊ Torso Strike. Before you make a melee attack with a
weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to
take a −5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, the
target can’t speak until the start of your next turn, after
which it is immune to the effects of Torso Strike for the
next minute.

◊ Leg Strike. Before you make a melee attack with a weapon
that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a −5
penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, the target's
speed is reduced by 10 feet (to a minimum speed of 10
feet). This effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

Once you have succeeded on this check three times, you
can’t use this benefit again until the next dawn.

You can only use one of these strikes per attack.

Your deep knowledge of the dangerous creatures that
inhabit the world aid you in both fighting and tracking
them. You gain the following benefits:

Vocalist Arcanist
Your unique method of weaving song into magic allows you
to enhance your spells through your magical vocals. When
you cast a spell that forces a target to make a saving throw
or requires you to make a spell attack roll, you can choose
to enhance the spell through song. You can wait until after
you roll the d20 before deciding to use this, but must decide
before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
When you do so, make a Charisma (Performance) check.
The DC for this check is equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On
a success, your proficiency bonus is doubled for the spell
attack roll or your save DC for that casting of the spell.

Wetland Explorer

◊ Select two creature types of your choice. Whenever you
roll initiative at the start of a combat that has one or
more hostile creatures of the chosen type, you can add
your proficiency bonus to the roll. If a creature has magically altered its form to appear as another creature type,
you don’t gain this benefit.
◊ You gain a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) and Wisdom
(Survival) checks involving one or more of the chosen
creature types.
◊ You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls made against a target
of the chosen creature type.

SKILLS
Below you’ll find two skills which are new to D&D and specifically used on the island of Obojima by crafters and potion
brewers alike.

Mechanics

Salvage

Your Intelligence (Mechanic) check measures

MAGIC ITEMS

n the world of Obojima, magic items are abundant and diverse, each possessing unique powers and abilities which are
sought after by a wide variety of people from spirit merchants and ramen chefs, to witches and adventurers alike. Some
magic items are imbued with the essence of elemental forces, such as fire, water, wind, and earth. Others may be relics of
the First Age or gifts from elder spirits, each with its own mysterious origins and hidden potential. Whether it be a sword that
bursts into flames with every swing or a magic bicycle that grants its rider the ability to soar through the skies, these magic
items play a crucial role in shaping the fate of those who possess them on Obojima.

Mundane Magic Items
Though adventurers often seek useful magic items to aid them in their endeavors, most magic items are used by islanders
seeking to make their lives or their professions easier. Magical tools and potions can be found all across Obojima in farms,
bakeries, bookbinders, and more.

CENSER OF ARGUING SPIRITS

Wondrous Item, Rare
This tarnished and dented teapot appears like an unimportant mundane item. Sloshing sounds can be heard from
within the pot when shaken, and it always feels warm to
the touch. When the lid is removed, three tendrils of
colored smoke rise from its blackened center. At the top
of the tendrils are the smushed faces of 3 elderly men, all
of which quickly begin to bicker amongst themselves. You
can ask each man one question, and he will answer to the
best of his ability. Once you have asked them all a question,
they begin to ignore you and continue to argue amongst
themselves until the lid is replaced at the top of the pot.
It’s unknown who these men were, but each seems to retain
knowledge from their past lives. Once you ask one of the
men a question, you can’t ask him another question until 7
days have passed.

Wondrous Item, Rare
This finely crafted gemstone pendant has a dark Corruption
sealed within it. Wearing it gives you the oddest desire to
visit the ocean. While wearing this pendant, you can use an
action to regain a number of hit points equal to one-third
of your hit point maximum. Using the corrupted pendant
in this way causes an unnatural rush that drains your body
and prevents you from resting normally. Once you regain
hit points in this way, you can’t benefit from a short rest
until the next dawn.
Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again
until the next dawn, after which point you must spend 1
hour performing a revitalizing ritual on the pendant for it

timer has been used in his way, it can’t be used again until
the next dawn.

springs forward at the call of its wielder. When you make a
melee attack with the spear, you can cause it to magically
extend, targeting a creature up to 15 feet away from you. For

take a −1 penalty to the attack roll.

16

17

An ordinary broom that has the extraordinary power to fly
and is surprisingly comfortable to ride. It’s controlled by

As part of a minute-long performance on this
First Age instrument, you can choose a lock
you can see within 15 feet of you and attempt
to pick it using the magic of music. Trying
to pick a lock in this way requires no other
tools besides the keytar. When you do so, you
make a Charisma (Performance) check against
the lock’s DC, instead of the Dexterity check
normally required. If you fail to unlock the
lock using the keytar, you can’t attempt to do
so again until 24 hours have passed.

20

19

GAMETOY

Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)

Gametoy comes with one cartridge with a random skill
proficiency stored inside.

21

GUARDIAN SPHERES

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
20

These ancient Nakudama devices float around the user at
all times, intercepting incoming attacks on their own. Each
Guardian Sphere has 5 hit points, which it will automatically sacrifice to reduce the total damage of an incoming
attack targeting the user. Once a sphere is reduced to 0
hit points, it goes inert and drops to the ground. Guardian
Spheres recover their hit points at dawn each day. There are

27

27

LAFULA’S IRON TEAPOT

Wondrous Item, Very Rare
Lafula’s Iron Teapot is tarnished with the wicked magic
of the mage Lafula. Tea brewed inside the pot imparts a
curse upon those who consume it. When used to brew
tea, the maker chooses one of the effects from the Bestow
Curse* spell. A pot of tea produces 6 portions. A creature
that consumes the tea is affected by the curse chosen by
the maker. The curse lasts for 1 year or until removed. A
creature affected by the tea’s curse can’t be affected by a
different curse produced by the tea. Once you use the iron
teapot to brew tea, you can’t do so again for 1 month.

28

OIKI’S PINWHEEL

Wondrous Item, Rare
As an action, Oiki’s Pinwheel can be spun and placed on
the ground. Each hostile creature within 120 feet of the
pinwheel that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or be stunned until the pinwheel stops spinning. The pinwheel spins for 1 minute, or it spins indefinitely as long as it is within a strong wind. An affected
creature can repeat the saving throw at the ends of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

29

Once Oiki’s Pinwheel stops spinning, its magic transfers to
another random pinwheel on the same plane of existence.

30

ONLY MEMBERS JACKET

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This stylish jacket has illusionary magic sewn into its seams.
While wearing the jacket, you can use an action to take on an
illusory disguise chosen by the jacket’s enchanter. The jacket
makes you—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and
other belongings on your person—look like the humanoid
chosen when the jacket was enchanted.

30

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its
action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on a
DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
The disguise lasts until the jacket is taken off.

173

31

PAINTER’S SUN HAT

Wondrous Item, Common

31

This well-made hat can come in any shape, size, or form
and from casual inspection seems to be mundane in nature.
However, when the hat is placed on the ground as an action
and its command word is spoken, it begins to float into
the air. The hovering hat then produces an illusion of a
humanoid of your choice that you are familiar with, with
the caveat that the illusion is wearing the hat. The figure
can’t move and fails to hold up to physical inspection. The
illusion remains until the hat is moved out of place, or until
the command word is spoken once more, causing the hat
to float back to the ground. A DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the figure is an illusion.

32

32

PENDANTS OF BELONGING

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
These pendants come in sets of four, six, or eight. While
worn, a creature always knows the direction of the other
pendants in its set.

33

PUNCH CARD

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
33

This old punch card from a long-forgotten tea shop somehow holds a unique enchantment, which punches a hole
in the card every time the creature carrying it is hit by an
attack; a hole can’t be punched in the card by any means
other than this enchantment. When found, the card has
1d6 punches already in it. When the tenth hole is punched
in the card, the magic is released, reducing the incoming
attack’s damage to 0. The card’s magic then fades.

34
34

ROAKE’S CLAY URN

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
As an action, you can present this clay urn and speak a
handful of ritualistic phrases unique to it. One spirit of
your choice that can see or hear you within 30 feet of
you must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, it is pulled inside the clay urn and sealed away. If the
spirit has a challenge rating of 3 or higher, it automatically
succeeds on the save.
While the spirit is sealed inside, it is in a state of slumber. It doesn’t need to eat or breathe, it doesn’t suffer from
any wounds or illnesses, and it ceases to age. The creature is released when the urn’s seal is broken or the urn is
destroyed. At which point, the creature reappears in the
nearest unoccupied space to the urn, waking up as if no
time had passed.
Once Roake’s Clay Urn has been used to seal a spirit, it can’t
be used again.

174

35

35

RUBY RED BIKE

Wondrous Item, Rare
This bicycle has a walking speed of 70 feet. After using
this bicycle to move at least 60 feet on your turn, you
can use an action to produce a fiery wall in the path you
took, as if from the Wall of Fire* spell. Once this property of the bicycle has been used, it can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

36

SCARF OF MUFFLING

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
This soft and well loved scarf wraps snugly around the
wearer’s neck, making anyone who adorns its feel extra
cozy. As an action, you can throw the scarf at a creature
within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed a DC 14
Dexterity saving throw or the scarf magically wraps around
its mouth, preventing it from speaking. A creature can use
its action to make a DC 14 Strength check, pulling the scarf
off itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
The scarf can be thrown in this way 3 times, and it regains
all expended uses daily at dawn.

37

36

SCUTTLING LANTERN

Wondrous Item, Common
As an action, you can touch the Scuttling Lantern to activate
it (causing it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 30 feet) or deactivate it (snuffing
out the light). While the lantern is lit, you can command it
to move once on each of your turns (no action required),
provided you are the one who activated it. When you do
so, the lantern moves up to 20 feet in a direction of your
choice. It deactivates if it is ever more than 500 feet away
from you. The lantern can move through water and across
any solid surface (including up, down, and across vertical
surfaces and upside down along ceilings). If you command
the lantern to follow you, it will always remain within 10
feet of you, provided no obstacles impede its path.

38

37

SIBLING PURSES

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
These two sibling coin pouches open up 5 inches wide and
can hold up to 5 pounds each. When you place an object
into one of the pouches, and the other pouch is within 20
feet of it, you can cause the object to teleport into the other
pouch, provided there is room to accommodate the object.

38

175

39

SODA CANS

Wondrous Item, Uncommon
There are a number of these strange beverages on the
island, and only those brave enough to drink them know
their magical effects.

39

◊ Melon Soda. This beverage grants the effect of 1 random
common combat potion.
◊ Cola Soda. This beverage grants the effect of 1 random
common utility potion.
◊ Fish Sauce Soda. This beverage grants the effect of 1

40

SOLAR AMULET

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
Whenever you regain hit points from a spell or magical
effect while wearing this amulet, you regain an additional
3 hit points.
40

41

SPLINTER BOW

Weapon (Any Bow), Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
This magical bow can split arrows as you fire it, allowing
you to target two creatures within 10 feet of each other.
When you use the bow in this way, you make only one
attack roll, which applies to both targets. If the attack hits
at least one of the targets, roll damage normally; each target
takes half the amount of damage rolled (rounded down).

41

42

STICKY HAND

Wondrous Item, Common
While holding this children’s toy in one hand,
you can cast the Retrieve spell.

42

43

SUNBAKED CASSETTES

Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by
a Spellcaster)

43

176

This sun-damaged cassette is beginning to lose hold of
the magic stored inside it. As a bonus action, you can hold
the cassette out in front of you in an attempt to draw out
its power. Roll a d4; on a roll of 3 or lower, you regain an
expended spell slot of a level equal to the number rolled
(if you don’t have any expended spell slots of that level,
you instead regain a spell slot of the next-highest level that
you have expended). On a roll of 4, you teleport 30 feet in a
random direction. Once you regain a spell slot in this way
you can’t do so again until the next dawn.

44

TALISMAN OF THE PHOENIX

Wondrous Item, Rare

44

This talisman has 1d4 charges. When you fail a death saving
throw while the talisman is on your person, you can choose
to expend a charge to succeed instead. Once all of the
talisman’s charges have been used, it burns up in a flash,
leaving behind a pile of ashes. It then reforms with 1d4
charges somewhere else on the same plane.

45

45

TRAVEL WOK

Weapon (Frying Pan), Rare
Unlike other frying pans, this enchanted wok both imbues its
food with healing properties and heats up to strike a burning
blow against its enemies. The wok is considered a +1 frying
pan, which deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit.
Not only can the wok cook food without the need for a fire,
creatures that eat food prepared in the wok within an hour of
it being cooked gain 1d6 temporary hit points. Temporary hit
points gained by the wok’s food last for 1 hour. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

46

UMBRELLA OF SHIELDING

Weapon (Umbrella), Uncommon (Requires Attunement)
This silk umbrella is reinforced with iron, making it as durable as it is heavy. It is considered a +1 umbrella. While wielding the umbrella and targeted by a ranged weapon attack, you
can use your reaction to gain a +5 bonus to your AC for that
attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you.

47

46

WEAPON OF THE SUN AND MOON

Weapon (Any), Rare (Requires Attunement)
A creature in possession of both the Lunar Weapon and the
Solar Amulet can perform a 1-hour ritual (as if attuning to a
magic item) to combine those items, forming the Weapon of
the Sun and Moon.
In addition to having the properties of both the Lunar Weapon
and the Solar Amulet, this weapon is considered a +1 Weapon
and gains two Eclipse Powers. During the day, the Weapon of
the Sun and Moon can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Darkness spell; this version of the spell creates a 60-foot-radius
sphere of darkness, instead of its normal size. During the
night, it can use its Eclipse Power to cast the Daylight spell.
Once the daytime Eclipse Power is used, it can’t be used again
until the next dawn; once the nighttime Eclipse Power is
used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.

SPELL CASTING ON OBOJIMA
n Obojima, spellcasters harness magic in a multitude of ways. Each follows arcane traditions passed down through
generations of budding witches and wizards, nomadic druids, and devoted paladins. These casters would go on to create
spells and practices that would later transcend their original uses and become integral parts of island life and culture.

Omitted Spells
You are always free to use any Dungeons & Dragons spell that you wish in your game, but there are going to be some spells
that break the immersion of the world of Obojima. Because of that, we have curated the D&D spell list for you so that you and
your players can have the full Obojima experience using only spells that align with the fundamental metaphysics and unique
flavor of this world. We hope you enjoy it!

BEAST TRANSMUTATION

BUTTERFLY STORM

2nd-level transmutation (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Wizard)

3rd-level conjuration (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (insect legs)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell transforms a beast that you can see within range
into a new humanoid form. An unwilling creature must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. The
spell has no effect on a beast with 0 hit points.

You create a chaotic cloud of butterflies in a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The
area is heavily obscured, and resting smoke or fog in the
area is dispersed.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the
target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form has the
appearance of a humanoid of any race you choose. The
target’s game statistics, excluding mental ability scores, are
replaced by the statistics of a commoner. It retains its
alignment and personality.

Creatures of your choice in the area when you cast this
spell ignore the following effects. For the duration, the
affected area is difficult terrain. When a creature attempts
to leave the spell’s area, it must make a Strength saving
throw. On a failed save, it is pulled back to an unoccupied
space closest to the center of the sphere.

The target assumes the hit points of its commoner form.
When it reverts to its normal form, the beast returns to the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the
excess damage doesn’t reduce the beast’s normal form to 0
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
the nature of its new form.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the spell’s duration increases by 1
hour for each slot level above 2nd.

BUBBLE LIFT
1st-level conjuration (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 hour
You blow a bubble around any solid, granular, or liquid
object that weighs 500 pounds or less, causing it to float
4 feet off the ground. No matter what the contents of the
bubble are, the bubble weighs 10 pounds and can be pushed
using an action. Strong winds or effects that would push
a creature also push the bubble. The bubble always floats
at least 4 feet off the ground, and descends from a fall at a
speed of 10 feet per round.
As an action, a creature can pierce the outside of the
bubble, causing it to pop and releasing its contents.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 2nd level or higher, you can increase the weight the
bubble can lift by 500 pounds for each slot level above 1st.

CONJURE OCEAN
3rd-level conjuration (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of witch’s eye coral)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You teleport a random 20-foot cube of water from the
bottom of the ocean to an area that you can see within
range. The water holds its cube shape as if held within a
container. A creature can enter and exit the water as it
normally would.
When the spell ends, the water loses its shape, crashing to
the ground and spreading outward. Any creature inside the
water at this time is carried 30 feet in a random direction.

CONTROL ANIMAL
2nd-level enchantment (Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of matted fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
Choose a beast that you can see within range. The beast
is affected if it has a challenge rating of 2 or lower; otherwise, the spell fails. An affected creature must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw, or you take total and precise control
of it, as your consciousness enters its body. While under the
effect of this spell, you can see through the creature’s eyes
and hear what it hears, gaining the benefits of any special
senses that the creature has. You can move and take actions
as the creature and can perform tasks the creature could
feasibly perform. During this time, your body is considered
unconscious; this doesn’t affect your ability to concentrate
on this spell.

If the creature takes damage, you must make a Wisdom
(Animal Handling) check, with a DC equal to 10 or half the
damage it took, whichever number is higher. On a failure,
the creature regains control of its body, and the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot
of 3rd level or higher, the maximum challenge rating affected
by this spell increases by 1 for each slot level above 2nd.

COUNTERSPY
2nd-level abjuration (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 5 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bag of sand and six candles)
Duration: 1 hour
You create an intricate arcane circle made of candles and
sand centered on a point on the ground within range. The
circle can have a radius of 10 feet or less. If at any point
before the spell ends a creature outside the circle can see
or hear you through magical or nonmagical means, the
candle’s flames will change color. If a spell or magical effect
was used, you are aware of it and understand the extent of
its effects.

CREATE SPIRIT TRAIN STOP
5th-level conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a blank ticket and high quality ink
worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: 1 hour
As you cast the spell, you inscribe onto your blank ticket
the code of a permanent train stop of your choice whose
stop number you’re already familiar with. A shimmering
sign and small bench appears behind you as the Wandering Line arrives on tracks which materialize before it. Your
ticket allows passage for you and up to eight creatures of
your choice. It takes 1 hour to arrive at your destination, no
matter the distance.
During your travel other stops may occur and are
determined by the GM. If you or any friendly creature
chooses to take a short rest while traveling and regains hit
points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more
Hit Dice, you also regain an extra 1d10 hit points.
There are countless train stops, each of which includes a
unique train stop number. When you first gain the ability
to cast this spell, you learn the code for two destinations,
determined by the GM. You can learn additional codes
during your adventures. You can commit a new code
sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

CRUSTACEAN FORM

DIVINE ARROW

6th-level abjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)

7th-level evocation (Bard, Cleric, Warlock)

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a rust crab shell)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pearl worth 100 gp)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a large ethereal crustacean form around your
body, which protects and aids you in combat. For the duration, your Armor Class becomes 20 (if it wasn’t already
higher), you gain a swimming speed of 40 feet, and you gain
blindsight out to a range of 30 feet. In addition, you can use
your bonus action to make a melee weapon attack using
your claws. This attack uses your spell attack bonus and
deals 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a hit.

You fire an angelic arrow from a bow made of light that
materializes in your hands. Make a ranged spell attack
against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes
4d10 force damage, and until the spell ends, it becomes
vulnerable to one of the following damage types of your
choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder. If a creature has immunity to the selected damage type,
it instead has resistance to that type for the duration; if a
creature has resistance to the selected damage type, it loses
that resistance for the duration.

Additionally, your ethereal shell has a damage threshold
of 15 hit points. A damage threshold gives you immunity to
all damage unless it is an amount of damage equal to or
greater than the threshold value, in which case you take
damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed
the shell’s damage threshold is considered superficial and
doesn’t reduce any hit points.

DARA BLOCKS
3rd-level conjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of sand and a piece of
pottery)

DUPLICATE
1st-level conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 5 feet
Components: S, M (copper powder and wax)
Duration: 1 hour
You create an exact replica of an object you can see within
range that weighs no more than 25 pounds. At first glance,
the two objects are indistinguishable from each other and
the duplicate functions as if it were the original, except for
any magical properties the original object may have. The
duplicate disappears when the spell ends.

You create five 1-foot cubes of magical force known as dara
blocks. Each dara block appears in a different unoccupied
space of your choice within range and becomes magically
fixed in place. The blocks are invisible to all creatures
except you and any creature you designate when you cast
the spell. A creature that can see the dara blocks (including one benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a
luminous cube made of a transparent, dark green light.

If a creature uses its action to examine the duplicate, the
creature can determine that it is a replica with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

A block fixed in the air can hold up to 5,000 pounds of
weight. More weight causes the block to fall. A creature can
use an action to make a Strength check against your spell
save DC, moving the fixed block up to 10 feet on a success.

EMBER BELLY

slot of 4th level or higher, you can create two additional
dara blocks for each slot level above 3rd.

Each creature in a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long line must make
a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d10 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Once you exhale the oil, the spell ends.

Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small ribbon)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Choose a creature within range. A gaudy crown and cape
appear on the target, accompanied by a disembodied
arrangement of brass instruments. For the duration, the
target becomes the Festival King and has an aura of importance that emanates from them. Any creature that moves to
a space within 20 feet of the Festival King for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there, must make a Charisma
saving throw. A creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on
this saving throw automatically. On a failed save, the creature becomes enamored with the Festival King, chanting,
and dancing around them. While under the effects of the
spell, creatures spend their action and bonus action at the
start of their turn giving all of their attention and admiration to the Festival King.
If a creature starts its turn outside of the Festival King’s
aura, it is no longer under the effects of the spell.

characteristics, such as a wooden body and face, but it lacks
hands and arms and can’t move.
Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within
10 feet of the shrub for the first time on a turn or starts its
turn there, is targeted by the shrub’s leaf attack. The shrub
makes a ranged weapon attack, using your spell attack
modifier. On a hit, a creature takes 1d4 slashing damage.
On your turn, you can use a bonus action to make a
shrub use its leaf attack against one creature within 10
feet of it. If multiple shrubs created by you are within 10
feet of the target, this attack deals 1d4 slashing damage
per shrub on a hit.

Casting Time: 1 action

it must still be in working condition.

Components: V, S, M (a small leather loop)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Six creatures or loose objects of your choice that you can
see within range rise vertically, up to 20 feet, and remain
suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a
target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature
that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.
A target can move only by pushing or pulling against a
fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a
ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You
can change the altitude of any number of targets by up to
20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are one of
the targets, you can move up or down as part of your move.
Otherwise, you can use your action to move the targets,

target, using your spellcasting ability modifier to resolve
the grapple. If you lose the contest, the paw disappears, and
the spell ends.
While grappled by the paw, a target takes 1d8 necrotic
damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can use its
action to attempt to escape the grapple as normal. When the
grapple is broken, the paw disappears, and the spell ends.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 2nd, summoning a separate
monkey paw for each target. When you do so, the spell

When a creature is hit with a ranged weapon attack using
the ammunition, it takes an extra 1d6 poison damage and
must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is pushed back a number of feet equal to
the damage taken (rounded up to the nearest 5
feet) to a maximum of 15 feet. Whether the

papers consumed in the casting of the spell and flies toward
a creature you can see within range. If the target is within
30 feet of you when you cast the spell, the swarm collides
with the target, dealing 8d6 slashing damage to it, and the
birds disappear.
If the target is farther than 30 feet away from you when
you cast the spell, the swarm travels at a rate of 30 feet per
round in the direction of the target, ignoring difficult
terrain and moving around creatures and other obstructions as needed. While the swarm is traveling, it obstructs a
5-foot-cube area as if it were a Medium creature.
While the swarm is traveling, it can be attacked. It has an
AC equal to your spell save DC. For every attack that hits the
swarm, the number of birds in the swarm is reduced by one.
At the start of your turn on the round that the swarm
reaches its target, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage for

thick materializes from the ground up in an unoccupied
space that you can see within range. The sand functions

You sprout and rapidly grow a lush leafy foliage that covers the
entirety of your body. When casting this spell, you can choose
if the foliage has other features, such as flowers or berries.
While prone and motionless, you are indistinguishable
from a normal bush. If a creature hasn’t observed you move
or act, it must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC to discern that you aren’t a
bush. To become disguised again from a creature that has
discerned you for what you are, you must take the Hide
action while you’re unseen by the creature.
For the duration, you can use your action to create and
hurl a pinecone, berry, or flower bud. When you do so,
make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 30 feet
of you. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal
to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

If you are not familiar with the creature, you can make
an ability check using your spellcasting ability modifier and
add your proficiency bonus to it. Refer to the table below to
determine what information you are able to glean from the
scent. When succeeding on a DC check, you also learn
previous information given from lower DCs.

Each creature in the stallion’s path (excluding the creature
it’s carrying, if any) must make a Dexterity saving throw,
taking 6d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The stallion then vanishes.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for
each slot level above 4th.

SUBMERGE

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 round
This spell creates a magical link between a body of water
within range and another body of water, at any location
within 500 miles, on the same plane of existence. You must
have seen or touched the destination body of water at least
once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the
target body of water and exit from the destination body of
water by using 5 feet of movement.
Both bodies of water must be large enough for the
creature attempting to pass through to become fully
submerged. If either body of water isn’t large enough for
the creature to become fully submerged, there’s a 25 percent
chance that the creature exits from a random body of water
on the same plane of existence.

be carried along with the stallion as it moves. A creature
can choose to fail this saving throw.

190

A giant jack-o’-lantern rapidly grows around up to four
Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature within a
5-foot radius centered on a point you can see within range.

saving throw, leaping 5 feet outside the jack-o’-lantern on
a success.
While inside the jack-o’-lantern, creatures can only see
through its eyes and mouth, which are on one side of the
jack-o’-lantern, selected by you when you cast this spell.
The creatures can make attacks with ranged or reach
weapons only from this side. Creatures outside the jack-o’lantern only see a warm, glowing light when looking into its
mouth or eyes. While the jack-o’-lantern remains, no
creature in, or outside of it can pass or reach through it.
The jack-o’-lantern weighs 5,000 pounds, has an AC of 15,
and has 100 hit points. The lantern naturally loses 20 hit
points every year. When the lantern is reduced to 0 hit
points, it is destroyed.

creature to gain a cape from its disguise, objects pass
through the cape, and anyone who touches it would feel
nothing or would feel the creature’s back or shoulders. If
this spell causes a creature to appear thinner than it is, the
hand of someone who reaches out to touch the creature
would bump into it while it was seemingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If
it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

TAMH GON’S FIERY FESTIVAL FEAST

Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
This spell allows you to change the appearance of two
humanoids that you can see within range. Each target takes
on an illusory disguise, making it look like the other target—
including its armor, clothing, weapons, and other belongings
on its person. Each creature can seem 1 foot shorter or taller;
the disguise otherwise replicates the other target’s physical
features as accurately as possible. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 15 feet
Components: S
Duration: Up to 1 hour
With a flick of your wrist, you magically complete a small
and simple task, such as flipping a book page, buttering
bread, or heating a cup of tea, without any physical interaction. The task can’t include anything that is intended to
inflict a harmful effect on a creature and must be something you’d normally be able to accomplish without the use
of magic. The spell fails if the target of the task has total
cover from you.
If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to
three tasks active at a time, and you can dismiss one of
them as a bonus action.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if this spell causes a

Duration: 1 round
You temporarily become invisible to stop yourself from
being discovered by the triggering creature. Until the end of
your next turn, you remain invisible and your steps make
no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across.
Anything you are wearing or carrying is invisible as long
as it is on your person. The spell ends early if you attack or
cast a spell.

VEGETABLE BLADE
3rd-level conjuration (Bard, Druid, Ranger, Paladin, Sorcerer)
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a strip of grass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A lush bunch of vegetable fronds suddenly springs from the
ground in an unoccupied space you can see within range.
As a bonus action, a creature can pull the fronds from the
ground, revealing a root vegetable of your choice that has
been grown in the shape of a blade. For the duration, a creature can use the vegetable blade as a melee weapon with
which it is proficient. The blade deals 1d12 slashing damage
on a hit (adding your ability modifier to the damage roll as
normal), and it has the finesse property.
Additionally, on subsequent turns, the wielder or one of
its allies can use a bonus action to take a bite out of the
blade. Doing so heals the creature for a number of hit points
equal to the blade’s damage die + your spellcasting ability
modifier. Once a creature has taken a bite out of the blade,
its damage die is reduced by one size—from a d12 to a d10,
for example. If the blade is reduced beyond a d4, it is
destroyed and the spell ends early.

WATER BULLET

POTION BREWING

agic abounds on Obojima. It permeates the landscape, and it pools in certain objects. Over the generations, sages
discovered that this latent magic can be unleashed through what has become the honored craft of potion brewing.
The craft is mysterious, wondrous, and more than a bit chaotic. Most people don’t even attempt it. Seasoned brewers can’t be entirely certain about what kind of potion will result when combining ingredients. Even so, the tradition remains
among the island’s proudest.
This chapter discusses how to gather ingredients, how to brew potions, and what kind of potions one can make.

Potion Types and Rarities
Potions come in one of three categories based on their function. Combat potions provide abilities or buffs that prove
helpful in a fight. Utility potions are generally useful both
in and out of combat. Finally, whimsy potions embody
peculiar and sometimes playful effects.
Potions also come in different rarities. A potion’s rarity is
determined by the rarity of the ingredients used to brew it.
A potion can be common, uncommon, or rare.
Common potions are familiar enough to be used by many
people in their day-to-day lives. However, they are not so
plentiful as to be considered mundane.

Uncommon potions are potent concoctions and likely the
upper end of power that folks would expect to encounter.
Rare potions do truly marvelous things and most folk
on Obojima live their lives without ever experiencing
their effects.
The people of Obojima might not describe potions in the
categories and rarities outlined above, but they are useful
terms meant to help players understand how the potion
system works.

193

Ingredients

Foraging and Salvaging

At the heart of potion brewing are ingredients. A vast
variety of objects scattered all throughout the island. Some
ingredients are plentiful and easy to find, while others are
seldom seen and might require a dangerous quest to obtain.
Ingredients come in various types including plants, minerals, creatures and creature parts, as well as human-made
things such as machine parts, toys, and food.

Characters might happen upon useful ingredients while
adventuring, but many ingredients demand a more active
search. The nature of the ingredient determines what skill
will be tested.

Like potions, ingredients have different rarities: common,
uncommon, or rare. To locate all 130 known ingredients, a
potion brewer must be skilled both behind the cauldron and
in the field.

◊ If an ingredient is found amongst abandoned machinery,
you might roll an Intelligence (Salvage) check to disassemble and locate the part needed.

Common ingredients are abundant and generally easy to
come by with a little bit of knowledge and effort.
Uncommon ingredients are harder to come by and require
a bit more specialized knowledge about where to find them.
Rare ingredients are another story altogether. Obtaining
them is a matter of great effort, and might require an expedition devoted to finding just one.

Tracking down a rare ingredient makes for a fun
adventure hook.

Identifying and Gathering
Ingredients
Only certain objects are potent enough to be ingredients
for the purpose of brewing potions. The Potion Ingredients
section below features a comprehensive list of ingredients.
Many objects players hope to brew into potions don’t carry
within them the necessary magic, therefore it’s important
that players have a way to determine what is and isn’t a
proper ingredient. That’s where Arcane Detection Kits and
almanacs come in handy. Bear in mind that the GM can
amend the ingredients list as they see fit.

194

◊ If an ingredient grows or is naturally found in the wild,
you might roll a Wisdom (Survival) check to determine
its location.

Any character who spends at least 1 hour foraging can
make the appropriate check. The DC of the check is determined by the table below. Not all ingredients show up in
each region with the same frequency. See the regional
ingredients list on page 199 to determine what ingredients
are native there.

You can find information on the new salvage

Almanacs

Ingredients of Circumstance

Granny Prumple’s Almanac of Island
Ingredients: The How-Tos and WhatFors on the Craft of Potions, in
Seven Volumes—or simply
Almanac for short–has
been the definitive guide
to ingredients for the
past several decades. The
information is not readily available, however.
Many years ago, witch
covens managed to divide the volumes, secreting them
away across Obojima to guard jealously in their own lairs
and covet the ones they don’t possess. Every major coven
has one, except for the distinguished Fish Head Coven,
which has somehow come into the possession of two!

A few ingredients can’t be foraged in the wild or salvaged
from derelict machines. Instead they appear through
circumstance. Rubble from a rubble golem, for example,
must be harvested from the creature of the same name,
which first requires the golem to exist. Other ingredients
can only be found as the result of a strange occurrence,
such as Essence of Ill Omen, which can randomly appear as
a byproduct of divination magic. These ingredients might
require more effort or a bit of luck to acquire.

Characters foraging or salvaging ingredients get advantage
on their rolls if they have access to the volume for the
region they are in. Additionally, players with access to an
almanac are aware of the attributes associated with each
ingredient listed in the book.

Almanac Volumes by Region and Coven
1. Brackwater Wetlands: The Crowsworn
2. Coastal Highlands: League of the Gilded Gourd
3. Gale Fields: Fish Head Coven
4. Gift of Shuritashi: The Tall Hats
5. Land of Hot Water: Patchwork Robe Coven
6. Mount Arbora: Cloud Cap Coven
7. The Shallows: Fish Head Coven

Heroes may be able to find copies of almanac
pages in local shops, libraries, or witch huts.
Finding a single almanac page will give information about one ingredient in particular.

Testing Ingredients
Arcane Detection Kits, or ADKs, are used to determine
if something has the properties necessary to be a potion
ingredient. As a downtime activity, characters can spend an
hour using their ADK to test up to six substances. Once a
test is complete, the GM shares which substances are ingredients and the attributes those ingredients hold.

Buying or Trading for Ingredients
Ingredients like pink candle wax, flash paper, and Hakumon’s ramen broth aren’t found in the wilderness. Artisans
make them, so they must be procured from the source, or
purchased from merchants. Common ingredients are typically found at local markets, uncommon ingredients require
an in with a special dealer, and rare ingredients are so
scarce that finding a dealer is an accomplishment in itself.
For characters looking to buy and trade ingredients follow
these general guidelines.
Cost. Merchants and artisans generally know what their
ingredients are worth. For ingredients that are typically
sold, feel free to assign a cost as you see fit, or consult the
table below for a suggested cost.
Making a Trade. Some folks are reluctant to give up an
ingredient. The rarer the ingredient, the tougher the coaxing will be. You are encouraged to roleplay the transaction.
The table below offers suggested DCs for Charisma (Persuasion) checks to successfully convince hesitant or shrewd
sellers to go through with the trade, though it’s up to the
GM whether the terms of the trade are reasonable.

Ingredient Attributes

Each ingredient holds a unique set of attributes that help
determine what type of potion it will be used to craft. These
attributes are combat, utility, and whimsy.

Utility

6
Whimsy

These three attributes have a number associated with
them, which varies by ingredient. The boom beri for
example has a combat score of 7, a utility score of 6, and a
whimsy score of 1.

Recipes

Whimsy

Potions require recipes. Every potion recipe has three main
ingredients, which determines the type of potion the recipe
will result in. Ingredients in a recipe must be unique, meaning there can’t be duplicates of one ingredient in the same
recipe. Recipes can be discovered through experimentation
or they can be found throughout Obojima—usually in the
hands of potion experts.

Rust Crab

To understand which potion a recipe will brew, follow the
steps for brewing below:

Utility

Combat

1. Select three ingredients.

Whimsy

2. Determine the three ingredients’ attribute numbers.
At the end of this step you should have a total of
nine numbers.
3. Find the sum of the three combat scores, three utility
scores, and three whimsy scores. At the end of this step
you should have three new numbers, each associated
with one attribute.
4. Determine which of these three attribute scores has the
highest number associated with it. The winning attribute determines the list the potion comes from, and
the number determines which potion on that list the
recipe will create. If there is a tie between attribute
scores, the potion brewer can choose between the two
winning attributes.
Example: You’ve decided to create a potion using these
three common ingredients. A handful of boom beris, a
couple sheets of flash paper, and a rust crab. You start by
pulling out an ADK and determine that these are the associated attribute scores for each of your ingredients.

196

You then find the sum of all three combat attribute scores,
utility attribute scores, and whimsy attribute scores. Which
looks something like this:
Combat

Utility

7+6+8=21 6+9+4=19

Whimsy

1+1+2=4

Now that you have three new numbers associated with
the three attributes, all you need to do is determine which
attribute’s number is the highest. In this case it looks like it
is Combat at 21.
That means if you were to brew this potion you will have
brewed the 21st potion on the combat potion list.

How to Brew Potions
After collecting ingredients and crafting a recipe, characters
can start brewing. To successfully brew a potion, a character must have access to, and be proficient with alchemy
supplies. Next, they must craft the base mixture to all
potions: a strange liquid known by witches and brewmasters as muk–a fine mixture of herbs, mud, candle wax, gold
dust, and a plethora of other simple substances. Muk is
what unlocks the latent magic in ingredients and makes
it ready for brewing. Mixing up a batch is easy enough, so
long as they have the gold needed to make it. Crafting muk
consumes gold, and each potion requires an amount of muk
based on the rarity.

If a character is persistent and continues to use multiple
potions in a day, they might stumble into a potion mishap.
These random magical effects occur when a character fails
a potions sickness check after already successfully using 3
potions that day. In addition to potion sickness, this character would also roll on the Potion Mishaps table below.
Poured and Thrown potions do not count towards the
number of potions a creature can consume in a day.
This is an optional rule for GMs to add into
their game as they see fit.

With all the necessary ingredients, the right amount
of muk, and alchemy supplies, a potion can be made in
10 minutes.
Common Potion

15 Gold worth of Muk

Uncommon Potion

75 Gold worth of Muk

Rare Potion

300 Gold worth of Muk

Using Potions
Each potion has magical effects that occur when imbibed,
poured out, or thrown. These effects last for a specified
amount of time, which is noted in a potion’s description.
Unless otherwise noted, it takes a bonus action to use the
potion and gain its benefits.

Multiple Potions at Once
Desperate, reckless, or curious characters will inevitably
try to use more than one potion at the same time or in
rapid succession. In most cases, potions don’t have stacking
effects. The most recent potion imbibed negates any
previous ones.
There are exceptions, however. Some potions are permanent, which means their effects persist even when other
potions are used. To see if a potion has this property, check
its description for the permanent keyword.

Potion Sickness & Mishaps
Using multiple potions also comes with the risk of
succumbing to potion sickness, a very unpleasant affliction
that comes on at a moment’s notice. Characters who decide
to consume more than one potion in a day must first pass a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall violently ill. In place
of the special effects the potion would normally grant the
character instead vomits as the strange concoction of magical elixirs swirls inside their stomach. The DC for this save
increases by 2 for each potion successfully used in a single
day. Thrown or poured potions do not count when calculating for potion sickness.

COMMON INGREDIENTS
Common ingredients are found all across Obojima and
are widely used in and out of potion making. The average
islander is most likely aware of, or can identify a handful of
common ingredients, though they likely use them for alternate purposes. As the name would suggest, common ingredients are much easier to come by than their uncommon
or rare counterparts, but the ratio at which the different
ingredients can be found are often shocking.

200

There are 69 known common ingredients. It’s been
reported by the Fish Head Coven that their witch apprentices find one uncommon ingredient for every five common
ingredients when exploring the wilderness. That makes it
roughly five times easier to find a common ingredient than
it is to find an uncommon ingredient.

highest-quality tea is found in fields where heirloom tea is cultivated and raised with great attention and care.

Clay Snake Tail

Combat

8

Utility

6

Whimsy

Clay snakes are fairly docile and non-venomous, which makes catching one a fairly easy task. The tips of a clay
snake’s tail are in high demand from witches and potion makers, and luckily for the clay snakes, their tails grow
back within a few weeks. Clay snakes are found by riverbanks and lakeshores where there are rich deposits of
clay, but the most desirable ones are found in the Land of Hot Water.

Dried fruit is plentiful on Obojima but there are certain artisans who know how to preserve and concentrate the
flavor and vibrancy of the fruit in such a way that it borders on mysticism. Although dried fruit can be bought at

burned at shrines and sacred sites throughout Obojima, delivering a complex and pleasing incense that clears

Looking like pumpkin-sized acorns, hill dragon eggs can remain dormant in the ground for a year or more before
they hatch. Hill dragon eggs are usually buried out of sight, but certain flowers like to grow around burial pits

sticky substance is often used as a sweetener. However, some canny craftspeople know the secret to making
strong glass-like vessels from it.

Yuma Shrub

The leaves of the yuma shrub secrete a strong, pleasant-smelling oil that is known to repel biting insects and
flies. Most soapmakers use yuma shrub oil in their soaps, and dogs and cats are often seen with a cluster of yuma
leaves tied to their collars to keep fleas and ticks away. Once the smell of the yuma shrub is experienced, then
they are quite easy to find by their smell alone and they can be found all over the island.

UNCOMMON INGREDIENTS
Like their common counterparts, uncommon ingredients
are found all across Obojima, though their uses outside of
potion making are often more eclectic. The average islander
is most likely aware of, or can identify a single uncommon ingredient. One such reason islanders are less aware
of these more uncommon ingredients is often due to their
affiliation with more dangerous locations or creatures.

There are 45 known uncommon ingredients. It’s been
reported that the Fish Head Coven believes uncommon
ingredients are roughly one hundred times easier to locate
and procure than a rare ingredient. This would make a rare
ingredient five hundred times more difficult to obtain than
a common ingredient.

the stones to spit sparks, shoot tiny flames, and sometimes burst apart with a bang. Obojimans are known to put
crackling jasper into tin cans tied to poles during festivals to scare away mischievous spirits. Crackling jasper is
found near hot springs and lava tubes within the Land of Hot Water.

Corrupted Seawater

Combat

17

Utility

11

Whimsy

14

Only the most advanced brewers or the most demented witches and warlocks are willing to expose themselves
to Corrupted seawater as there is still little known about it. This purplish water has the Corruption’s signature
sickly, acrid stench. For those who are intrepid enough to venture to the eastern side of Obojima, Corrupted
seawater is easy enough to find, but be sure to bring a container that can keep the noxious fluid from spreading
its contamination.

Corrupted Slime

Combat

16

Utility

14

Whimsy

13

Slime that has become affected by the Corruption becomes opaque and inky, staining things it comes in contact
with. Corrupted slime retains its viscosity but it’s quite sticky. By all accounts, being near Corrupted slime is
uniquely unpleasant and those who touch it have been known to become lethargic and listless. Corrupted slime
can be cultivated from slime monsters that have themselves been corrupted.

Hakumon’s Ramen Broth

Combat

12

Utility

14

Whimsy

17

The ramen broth made by master ramen chef, Hakumon, is legendary among chefs and potion makers alike for
its particularly potent effects. Many ramen competitors and potion makers have been known to pay a high price
to secure a container-full of broth from Hakumon’s famed ramen shop. But be warned! For Hakumon, ramen is
no laughing matter, and the master chef takes great pains to ensure that thieves and miscreants cannot steal his
broth so easily.

Dawn Petal

Combat

11

Utility

13

Whimsy

17

The petals of the dawn blossom petals are admired by Obojimans for their unique shape, fragrance, and golden
luster. Dawn blossom trees don’t propagate like other trees as each dawn blossom tree has been planted by a
nature spirit that then inhabits the tree. Despite the efforts of ambitious horticulturists, dawn blossom trees
only grow where they are planted by their host spirit. Because of this, they are quite uncommon and considered
sacred by most villagers.

Dragon Root

Combat

14

Utility

15

Whimsy

16

There is no discernable rhyme or reason for where dragon root is located on Obojima. But like all such mysteries,
legends abound. The story most often repeated regarding dragon root claims that wherever it is found, it marks
the footfalls of a spirit dragon from a bygone age named Runivarish. Whether or not this is true, or not, locals
do find it peculiar that dragon root, once harvested, will grow in the exact same spot, as if marking something.
Dragon root burns hotter than most woods and coals and is therefore valuable to both brewers and smiths.

Essence of Ill Omen

Combat

16

Utility

12

Whimsy

11

There is great debate among witches whether this mercurial substance is caused by or is the cause of evil tidings,
though it is understood that this ashy residue is a potent component in warding magic or spells associated with
fortune. Essence of Ill Omen is created spontaneously as a kind of magical feedback from divination magic,
which manifests as a puff of sooty vapor that can be captured in any kind of airtight vessel.

Essence of Glumbug

Combat

11

Utility

11

Whimsy

17

Whoever first learned the art of glumbug tickling has been lost to time, but there are a few old-timers left who
are willing to teach a willing pupil a few tricks. Glumbug ticklers are the only ones who know how to extract
the glowing glumbug essence, as it cannot be gathered by squashing or dissecting the shiny bugs. Glumbugs are
mostly found under stones and in caves.

Feather Rock

Combat

13

Utility

17

Whimsy

15

As its name suggests, feather rock is a paradoxical stone with a peculiar nature that seems to contradict the pull
of gravity. These spindle-shaped stones always reach skyward, while remaining anchored to the ground on a
tapered point. Even if these stones are tipped over, they return to their “reaching” position. Howlers covet feather rock. Small chunks of feather rock are distributed across the island, but larger stones are found in deposits
primarily in the Gale Fields.

Fizzing Green

Combat

12

Utility

14

Whimsy

12

Deep within the forests of Obojima, there is a very special plant called a spiral fern that is the source of fizzing
green. Only a few druids and naturalists know the secret to getting a spiral fern to release fizzing green, and they
are reluctant to tell, but will gladly go and harvest the strange, effervescent substance for a trade.

Forge Slag

Combat

15

Utility

14

Whimsy

11

Forge slag can be gathered at any foundry or blacksmithing forge, but the slag created by the fire and hammer
strokes of a master smith is what potion makers are searching for, as there is always latent magic in the work
of a master.

Gargoyle Powder

Combat

15

Utility

16

Whimsy

13

Gargoyle powder comes from ground-up dragon eggs that have been encased in ash from ancient eruptions.
Grinding up these eggs releases the magic within their bones and is often used in petrification spells, hence the
name. Gargoyle powder can be bought or traded only with merchants and wizards who specifically deal with
such materials. Other than that, seeking out petrified eggs in the ancient ash fields on the sides of the volcano is
a much more difficult and perilous task.

Glow Worms of the Vale

Combat

12

Utility

15

Whimsy

14

Glow worms are found in caves and marshes across Obojima and work fine as ingredients in potions, but intrepid
potion brewers have discovered that the wildly-colored glow worms found in the Vale of Abundance in the Gale
Fields have a much greater potency.

211

Happy Joy Cake

Combat

12

Utility

13

Whimsy

12

The makers of Happy Joy Cake are a secretive family and it is believed that at least one of them is a spirit, but
Obojimans are nevertheless in love with the small, bite-sized treats whose recipe has been handed down for
generations. Although Happy Joy Cakes are made only in Yatamon, there are a few trusted traveling merchants
who are allowed to distribute them across the island.

Kojobi Fruit

Combat

14

Utility

14

Whimsy

14

Almost every village has a couple of kojobi trees in it but they only fruit every two or three years. When a kojobi
tree bears fruit it is a cause for celebration and everyone comes to take part in a Kojobi Festival where the abundant fruit is made into all kinds of dishes and beverages to be enjoyed by all.

Laughing Moss

Combat

11

Utility

16

Whimsy

16

Laughing moss is well-known amongst naturalists and woodcutters, as it’s fairly easy to find when you know
what you’re looking for. To find a patch of this moss is quite simple, as all you need to do is head to the woods
and listen for the distinctive sounds of hearty laughter emanating from a campsite in the evening. Along with
finding it in the wild, laughing moss is sold in special apothecaries around the island.

Living Spud

Combat

14

Utility

12

Whimsy

17

Every now and then, a spud pops out of the ground and begins a long meandering trek. Obojiman farmers call
them “living spuds” and they are objects of curiosity and reverence. Wagons will stop on roads and people in
crowded markets will make way to let a living spud trundle through. But whatever it is that animates these
wayward potatoes, that magic is desired by potion brewers who will use even the smallest snip of a living spud to
power their brews.

Lions Blume

Combat

17

Utility

13

Whimsy

16

This carnivorous flower is characterized by a maw at the center of its array of honey-colored petals. Beekeepers
consider the flower an invasive weed that devours bee populations. Lions blume grows in patches known as
prides on the high moors of the Coastal Highlands. Each pride has its own lineage which tries to choke out other
prides growing nearby. Brewers seek out lions blume because of the flower’s milky sap as well as its “teeth.”

Magic Monk’s Rice Wine

Combat

16

Utility

12

Whimsy

15

Magic Monk’s Rice Wine is a delicious and refreshing high-end spirit. Many who imbibe it say it stimulates the
intellect and afterward their dreams are far more vivid. On each of the solstices, a delivery of Magic Monk’s Rice
Wine is handled by teams of spirits who mysteriously appear and distribute it to the taverns and temples of Obojima. Magic Monk’s Rice Wine is brewed and distilled in some unknown location within the spirit realm.

Molted Lizard Skin

Combat

15

Utility

12

Whimsy

12

For maximum results, try to find a whole skin that has been thoroughly dried by the sun. The crispier the better.

Mountain Snail

Combat

14

Utility

15

Whimsy

12

As a potion ingredient, the mountain snail’s value is in its shell, which when pulverized into a powder, is used
in magics associated with protection. However, it’s a perilous pursuit cultivating mountain snails, for they tend
to live in the lairs of dangerous predators who live in mountain caves. There, the snails feed off meat scraps left
behind. The snails avoid detection by masquerading as stones, though they are drawn to music.

212

Mournshade

Combat

13

Utility

14

Whimsy

13

Mournshade is used by healers across the island for what they believe is the plant’s ability to absorb painful
emotions. Although it is rare to find in the wild, there always seems to be someone in the village who has a
sachet full of mournshade just in case.
Mournshade is found in bogs and swampy wetlands where it faintly glows on moonless nights.

Munchanka Root

Combat

17

Utility

11

Whimsy

11

The root of the deadly munchanka plant must be handled and processed with skill and care, for it is said that
those who have eaten the wrong parts of this plant have been driven mad. Munchanka root can be found in dry,
arid regions.

Nakudama Spice

Combat

12

Utility

15

Whimsy

14

With its distinct earthy flavor, this spice was once part of a culinary fad among Nakudama. It has since fallen out
of fashion, but the name remains. The spice comes from the zelk bean, which grows from a species of pond lily.
These beans are harvested, fermented, and then dried before being ground into a purple powder. A few Nakudama farmers continue to make it, but because the process of producing Nakudama spice is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, it isn’t cheap.

Night Thistle

Combat

14

Utility

17

Whimsy

16

It is said that the night thistle came with the Corruption and only grows on the graves of restless spirits. It
blooms only on the darkest night of the new moon, putting forth an eerily skeletal, bioluminescent flower that
attracts nocturnal pollinators. Night thistles are only found near and within corrupted regions making it dangerous to collect.

Noodle Eel

Combat

13

Utility

12

Whimsy

16

Every now and then, a ramen chef finds a gorged noodle eel sleepily coiled in an empty bowl of theirs. All ramen
chefs see them as pests as apparently noodle eels have a rather refined palate and don’t come to just any bowl of
broth, seeking only to slurp down the finest ramen—a major irritant to serious chefs. This makes catching one
difficult as it requires good ramen and no self-respecting chef will sacrifice their work for bait.

Opu Opu Spring Water

Combat

11

Utility

16

Whimsy

14

The sacred water from the Opu Opu Spring has always been famous for its healing properties. Villagers would
come from all around and make the long trek up into the mountains to collect the spring water, but recently a
large troll has moved into the area and the villagers have been too afraid to travel there. Because of this, supplies
of the spring water are now at an all-time low.

Pok Pok Flakes

Combat

13

Utility

14

Whimsy

13

For those potion makers who have a culinary flair, using dried flakes from the pok pok fish is a way to give a
savory and sorcerous kick to any brew. Pok pok fish are notoriously hard to catch, but there are a few fisherfolk
on the island who know all the tricks of the trade. They usually sell their wares direct to potion makers or market
shops that specialize in potion ingredients and spell components.

Petrified Alligator

Combat

15

Utility

16

Whimsy

13

Bards speak of the mad druid Fennistrix, who had a penchant for petrification along with a bizarre alligator
obsession that resulted in almost all of the alligators on Obojima being petrified and displayed. Legend says that
when Fennistrix’s taxidermy hut exploded, petrified alligator parts scattered all over the island. It’s rare nowadays to find a foot or a head, let alone an entire alligator, but even a small amount of it ground up releases some
of Fennistrix’s potent magic.

213

Rubble from a Rubble Golem

Combat

16

Utility

11

Whimsy

15

When the animus of a rubble golem falls silent, some amount of magic continues to radiate from the chunks of
debris that its body was formed from. At night, occasional motes of white light shoot off from these broken bits.
Brewers seek this material for its inherent magical quality, which they can use for various purposes.

Shadowroot

Combat

15

Utility

13

Whimsy

12

This small, knobby root only grows where its black leaves are left in perpetual shadow. Once harvested, the root
must be wrapped or sealed away from light or it will rapidly wither and rot.

Scumweed

Combat

11

Utility

12

Whimsy

11

Whether it was brought by the Corruption or a local plant was mutated by it, scumweed has appeared on the corrupted coastlines of Obojima and is creeping further inland along sloughs and marshes that are affected by the
encroaching Corruption. Scumweed is slimy and thick. Dried scumweed can even make hardy armor in a pinch
and more than a few monsters and witches have been known to use it for precisely that purpose.

Sleeping Merchant

Combat

13

Utility

13

Whimsy

13

Known for its naturally soporific effects, the sleeping merchant got its name through its use by traveling traders
who traditionally drink its dried blossoms as a tea after a busy day of hocking their wares. This water lily can be
identified by the nodding white blossom under a leafy umbrella. The sleeping merchant only grows in certain
ponds and lakes which has made attempts to grow sleeping merchant plants in other bodies of water impossible.
Thus, the demand for this plant is high among the tea vendors of Obojima.

Spark Plug

Combat

11

Utility

17

Whimsy

11

Spark plugs are used by potion makers to add in a small charge of magic, just enough to be a catalyst for a specific reaction. Most Obojimans still have no idea what these strange items are, let alone where they come from but
the rangers and rogues who do keep the information to themselves.

Spirit Tea

Combat

11

Utility

11

Whimsy

17

There are many fine teas to be tried all over Obojima, but only a few are legendary. One such tea is made by the
master tea blender, Chisuay. It is said that Chisuay leaves his body and brews this tea in the Spirit Realm, then,
through powerful magic, he brings this delicate spiritual brew back into the Material Plane. Spirit tea can only be
found at Chisuay’s teahouse.

Spring

Combat

14

Utility

17

Whimsy

15

Springs come in various sizes from different machines. Because of their spiral shape and ferrous material, they
are prized by magic users to channel energies into spells and potions. Merchants who deal in arcana are always
looking for springs found within the ruins of those who came before.

Sun Shroom

Combat

13

Utility

16

Whimsy

14

Discovered by the wizard known as Karoglin the Sleepless, the sun shroom allows those who consume it to stay
awake for long periods of time. Overuse can lead to extended bouts of uncontrollable laughter and eventually
deep restless sleep. Sun shroom has a briny taste and is most commonly consumed by mixing it in tea. Sun
shrooms tend to grow near the roots of trees in the Wandering Forest, a fact that has led some to speculate that
energizing mushrooms are what keep the trees on the move.

214

Toka Truffle

Combat

15

Utility

12

Whimsy

14

Toka truffles are the goal of every truffle hunter as their pungency and deliciousness are renowned. But it was
only recently that potion makers discovered the magic properties of the truffle, making competition to find these
valuable delicacies even more heated. Toka truffles are found underground near oak trees. Apart from magic
spells or items, prized truffle hunting hogs are the best way to find these hidden treasures.

Vinyl Record

Combat

15

Utility

15

Whimsy

15

These black disks are covered in a continuous spiral that moves to the center of the disk—believed to be an
ancient and lost way of recording knowledge. Some sages know how to unlock the messages within the grooves,
while many Obojiman potion makers grind or melt these “records” to release the magic they contain. These
objects are found in caches where they are often stacked like plates in a restaurant. But discoveries are few and
far between, and merchants are sure to drive a hard bargain.

Wolfenite

Combat

11

Utility

17

Whimsy

11

Wolfenite is found high in the mountains in cracks and crevices between the granite boulders. For those who are
more intrepid and willing to take the risk, sneaking into a howler den is another way to find a cache of this rare
mineral as they are for some reason drawn to this rare mineral.

Wychwood

Combat

14

Utility

13

Whimsy

15

The twisted, spined branches of a wychwood tree are well known by wizards and those who practice magic
involving spirits. Many warlocks and druids use wychwood wands for their spellcasting. It is said that wychwood
trees only grow in a few groves where spirits are plentiful, places where magic flows from the ground, and where
the light of the full moon can touch their branches.

Yellow Slime

Combat

17

Utility

11

Whimsy

11

Only those with iron constitutions or equipped with the right protective gear can withstand the nausea often
brought on by the slime’s ripe, vinegary stench. Brewers have spent generations learning how to neutralize the
unpleasant smell because yellow slime also possesses the ability to metabolize many venoms and poisons. The
substance yellow slime is cultivated from larger, living omnivorous monsters of the same name.

RARE INGREDIENTS
Rare ingredients are unlike common and uncommon
ingredient in many ways. The average islander has most
likely never heard of a rare ingredient, and if they have
it’s unlikely they’re aware of the fact that it can be used in
potion crafting. When using a rare ingredient, you’re often
utilizing a resource with limited or no capabilities of replenishing itself, making it even harder for the next potion
brewer in need of said ingredient.

There are 21 known rare ingredients, each of which are
unlisted in any recorded witch almanac. In order to find a
rare ingredient, potion brewers are often required to chase
down rumors or offer up heavy trades to get an idea of a
rare ingredient’s location.

215

Blossom of Spirit Vine

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

19

There are three cryptic alchemical tomes on Obojima that speak of the arcane energies of spirit vine and its uses.
Only the most expert potion makers understand how to work with this plant, and of those, only a few can fully
release its power. Spirit vine only grows in the Spirit Realm, where it is abundant. However, what makes this
plant unique is the blossom. At any given moment, there is only one blossom in existence. When it wilts or is
harvested, another one will form on another vine in a random location.

Bottled Lightning

Combat

20

Utility

20

Whimsy

18

Few wizards attempt such a feat and even fewer succeed at bottling lightning. The method, magic, and equipment used in achieving bottled lightning are all closely guarded secrets. For those wishing to get some of this
crackling power, be warned that wizards charge a hefty fee for even the smallest bottle. Wizards who bottle
lightning can be found, usually by hearing stories of their mountaintop towers or their mad wandering into
lightning storms.

Bubble Gum

Combat

18

Utility

19

Whimsy

20

Though its flavors are many, all bubble gum is rare. It is most commonly found stuck to walls or floors in ruined
buildings or stuck to the bottoms of shoes. Rarer still is bubble gum found un-chewed and still in its foil wrapper. The chew-it-but-don’t-swallow-it nature of bubble gum is confounding to many on the island, and academics
on the island refer to the delightful substance as “masticant.”

Coal From The Wandering Line

Combat

19

Utility

19

Whimsy

20

As the Wandering Line trundles across the island, the occasional bit of coal that feeds its boiler bounces out,
landing by the side of the track. These fist-sized chunks resemble mundane coal in most respects, but they have
bright blue iridescent flecks in them and they vibrate sporadically. As there are no longer coal mines on Obojima,
the origin of this coal remains a mystery.

Crimson Octopus Ink

Combat

19

Utility

18

Whimsy

19

Artisans and scribes who use ink from the rare crimson octopus profess it makes the highest quality ink and
dye on the island. But potion makers have found arcane uses for the ink as well, and sometimes there are heated
arguments about who deserves to use the extremely rare and prized ink more. There are only three known crimson octopuses in the Shallows and the Lionfish King feverishly guards one of them. To make matters even more
difficult for would-be poachers or ink harvesters, crimson octopuses are intelligent, wary masters of camouflage
who rarely come out during the day.

Dragon Fang of Yutro

Combat

20

Utility

18

Whimsy

19

In a bygone age, the dragon Yutro tormented Obojima from its lair on Mount Arbora. It threatened to eat every
last living creature on the island unless each family sent one member as a sacrifice. Ineh, a young Nakudama
metalsmith, was sent to represent her family. But she brought with her a hammer, for she had no intention of
being eaten. A battle ensued. Aided by many spirits, Ineh smashed the fangs from Yutro’s maw, scattering them
to the far corners of the island. Fangless, Yutro surrendered to Ineh and retreated into the mountain. To this
day, however, Yutro’s fangs can be found in random places on Obojima, often embedded in the earth, in trees, or
even in stone.

216

Fairy Willow

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

20

The fairy willow grows in the Spirit Realm but it appears in the physical world when it is time to bloom their soft
catkins in early spring. There is a botanical society on Obojima that tries to predict every year where the fairy
willow will bloom, and they haven’t yet chosen the same place twice in a row.

Giant Koi Fish Scale

Combat

18

Utility

20

Whimsy

18

The giant flying koi lazily drift among the clouds where the sun reflects on their glistening scales. Every now and
then, one of these scales flakes off and floats down to the ground, sometimes landing on a rooftop which is almost always seen as a good omen and cause for celebration. There are many temples and shrines that have giant
koi scales as venerated objects, and some have scenes painted on them by master artisans.

Golden Root

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

18

There are only a few ancient trees with roots that stretch into the deepest depths of the heart of Obojima. These
roots absorb the harmonious energy of the natural world, which turns them into gold. Gathering them requires a
respectful and cooperative relationship with the forest spirits that guard these ancient trees. Only then will they
offer a golden root to a worthy potion maker.

Hand of Eryo

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

19

These extremely rare mushrooms are the most desired of all the edible mushrooms on Obojima. They tend to
grow in the uppermost branches, where they appear to be grasping at the sky. Forest spirits who locate one of
these mushrooms will descend on it with ravenous frenzy, so foragers who hope to harvest some of their own
might find stiff competition.

Irimbi Chrysalis

Combat

19

Utility

20

Whimsy

18

Every ten years, deep in the forests of Obojima, the rare irimbi caterpillar climbs to the highest branches to make
a jade-green chrysalis in which it transforms into an irimbi butterfly. The chrysalis feels like delicate rice paper
to the touch, and finding one intact is almost impossible due to tree mites, which tend to make quick work of
their favorite meal.

Lionfish Poison

Combat

20

Utility

0

Whimsy

0

Only the Lionfish King or one of his royal line is capable of producing this potent poison, and to procure even a
tiny bit of it is a treasure indeed. Many who have tried to steal such a prize have wound up shark food or washed
up on shore—poisoned by the very substance they sought to steal.

217

Nokumai’s Frozen Breath

Combat

0

Utility

0

Whimsy

20

High up beyond the snowline is a stark realm where many magical beings reside. One of them is the legendary
snow dragon, Nokumai, whose icy breath is desired by all who deal in things of an arcane nature. It’s rumored
that Nokumai’s Frozen Breath never thaws, and the great dragon only breathes once every thousand years, although no one living has actually seen Nokumai and the dragon may be long gone.

Orange Slime

Combat

20

Utility

20

Whimsy

20

Use with caution. Handle with care. You have been warned. Orange slime is highly combustible, even in small
globules. It is also quite volatile. With the slightest agitation, the sticky, gelatinous substance can reduce stone and
concrete to rubble. Most towns and villages prohibit orange slime, and its discovery is often met with panic. If
orange slime is discovered, there’s usually a designated mage nearby who can be summoned to contain or dispose
of it. The substance orange slime is cultivated from larger, living omnivorous monsters of the same name.
It is exceedingly rare, as orange slime monsters appear only in a handful of caverns near the peak of Mount Arbora.

Ota Lantern Oil

Combat

0

Utility

20

Whimsy

0

A lamp lit with Ota Lantern Oil can give one glimpses of the Spirit Realm. The oil is a special blend known only
to members of the insular Ota Clan, but some of its ingredients are said to be sourced from the Spirit Realm
itself. The Ota Clan sells only very small batches of their lantern oil at exorbitant prices from their village shop,
but they have been known to trade for other rare and unique items.

Plumage of a Running Kirio

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

19

The Running Kirio is a rare bird of paradise with brilliant red plumage that appears only when an elder spirit is
nearby. For the extremely lucky forager, the running kirio bird may shed a tail feather with all its vigorous sprinting and hopping when heralding the manifestation of an elder spirit, but many of those tail feathers are collected
by the druids who, after a sighting of an elder spirit, are sure to scour the area for this most exotic of prizes.

Ronin Neko Figurine

Combat

0

Utility

19

Whimsy

18

This artifact depicts a limited edition figurine of Ronin Neko, a heroic cat who fought against monsters and defended the innocent. Only a few of these figurines have ever been found, but there are a few Obojiman historians who have unearthed illustrated tomes depicting the story of Ronin Neko and his brave exploits.

Sage Arol’s Beetle

Combat

18

Utility

20

Whimsy

0

These beetles were made famous by the legendary sage, Arol, for his use of their mandibles as quills for his pen.
But potion makers began to use the beetles for potion crafting when a witch from the Fish Head Coven began to
see the rare bug in her dreams. Sage Arol’s Beetles live deep underground, fleeing even the dimmest light. On
rare occasions, they come to the surface, though the reason remains a mystery.

218

Starstone

Combat

18

Utility

0

Whimsy

19

Starstone is a glittering crystalline rock that came from an ancient comet that broke up over Obojima long ago
and scattered fragments across the island. Nakudama sages talk of this event in their sacred books, saying it was
an auspicious omen, and ever since that time, the hunt for fragments of this Starstone has been undertaken.
Starstone is very rare and is found lying on the ground or embedded in the earth. It is identified by its signature
teardrop shape and magical shimmer.

Tears of the Moon

Combat

18

Utility

18

Whimsy

18

On certain nights, a cloud in the Spirit Realm passes into the physical world and is struck by the moon’s rays
which crystallizes it into a glittering mist known as moonbreath. On rare occasions, moonbreath may form into
larger crystals known as tears of the moon, that fall to the earth to be discovered by a lucky traveler.

Wufu Whisky

Combat

19

Utility

19

Whimsy

19

The location of the Wufu Distillery is a mystery, but the master distiller, Wufu, is well-known throughout Obojima where once every year he is seen buying the highest quality grains for his masterful Wufu whiskey. Master
Wufu only sells a few bottles of his whiskey to the highest bidder or gives them as gifts to old friends. Some
think he is a spirit or a wizard as all attempts to track him have failed. Wufu whiskey is kept in beautiful earthenware jars, sealed with the Wufu emblem. Those who have tasted the legendary whiskey are said to have tasted
the spirit of kings.

POTIONS
Below you will find a comprehensive list of the potions made available through crafting. The potions are organized in order
of rarity and separated by type (Combat, Utility, & Whimsy). Each potion has a number associated with it, which is used to

SHEPHERD’S BANE

It is said that this potion was first brewed in the Gale
Fields by a young shepherd looking to protect their flock.
The irony was not lost on them when they drank the
potion and took on wolflike features. When you drink this
potion, you grow claws which last for 1 hour. For the duration, your unarmed strikes using your claws deal slashing
damage equal to 1d6 plus your Strength modifier, instead
of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

8

BOTTLED BOMB

When thrown at a point that you can see within 60 feet of
you, this volatile liquid explodes. Each creature within 5

throw, taking 1d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

9

attacks and damage.

CANDLECAP

After imbibing this potion, you gain lively flaming locks,
which last for 1 hour and shed bright light in a 20-foot
radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. Once on
each of your turns for the duration, you can cause an
unarmed strike made with your head to deal an extra 1d4
fire damage. Additionally, you can take an action to cause
the flame on your head to flare up and burst outward,
dealing 2d4 fire damage to all other creatures within 5 feet
of you; using this ability causes the effects of this potion
to end early.

11

EAGLE’S VISION

and turn the golden color of an eagle. For the next minute,
attacking at long range doesn’t impose disadvantage on
your ranged weapon attack rolls.

along with the sneaking suspicion that you are being
stalked. For the next 8 hours, you can’t be surprised.

13

BOTTLED TORCH

When uncorked, this potion spews a hot yellow flame
from its bottle for 1 minute, which resembles the shape of
a blade. For the duration, you can make a melee weapon
attack with the fiery blade as if it were an improvised
weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 fire damage. The
blade disappears early if it is submerged in water.

static electricity. Immediately after a creature touches you
or hits you with a melee attack made with a metal weapon
in the next 24 hours, you can use your reaction to send a

1d10 lightning damage to it. Once you do so, the effects of
this potion end.

your voice gains a crackling quality to it and your breath
sparks and sputters. For the duration, you can use a bonus
action to exhale an arc of lightning at a creature you can
see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, taking 1d10 lightning damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Once you exhale this lightning, the effects of this
potion end.

222

HEROISM

When you drink this glowing red elixir, you gain advantage
on the next attack roll you make within the next 24 hours.

18

SLUGSKIN

Drinking this potion makes your skin thick, slippery, and
rubbery. Spears and sharp objects that would normally
pierce your skin have a hard time getting through this
tough texture. For the next minute, you have resistance
to piercing damage. While the potion is active, you can
choose to exude a slime trail as part of your movement.

19

THUNDERBELCH

Upon ingesting this fiercely fizzing potion, roll a d4 to
determine the number of rounds before you let forth a
thunderous belch of epic proportions. On your turn that
round, you must use your action to release the belch. Each
creature other than you within 10 feet of you must make a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is deafened until the
end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened.

20

SEEKING SMOKE

When thrown at a creature that you can see within 30 feet
of you, this shimmering liquid explodes, releasing a billowing cloud of smoke. The targeted creature must succeed on
a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, or be coated in a cloak of

DANCING JUICE

You can coat one melee weapon with this potion. When
you hit a creature with the coated weapon in the next
hour, you can force it to make a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, the weapon is no longer coated in
the potion, and the target begins to convulse in a manner
that could be mistaken for an awkward, clumsy series of
dance steps. The target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the
end of its next turn, after which the convulsing ends.

22

PRICKLESKIN

Drinking this potion causes spines to emerge all over your
body. These spines lay flat but can be controlled by you to
stand on end. When you successfully grapple a creature
and as a bonus action while it remains grappled, you can
deal 1d4 piercing damage to the target. The effects of this
potion last for 1 minute.

23

TINY BUBBLES

Drinking this pink, bitter-tasting potion, causes hundreds
of small, iridescent bubbles to emerge from your nose and
mouth and fill a 20-foot cube that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the bubbles are left untouched, they float in
place, remaining there for 1 hour. When a creature enters a
space occupied by the bubbles for the first time on a turn,
it must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, a cacophony of popping erupts as the bubbles burst,
dealing 1d6 thunder damage to all creatures inside the
cube. The sound of the bubbles popping can be heard from
a mile away.

24

CLAWS OF THE CRAB KING

Your hands turn into a handsome set of powerful crab
claws. For 1 minute, your unarmed strikes using the claws
deal double damage to objects and structures, and you
make grapple checks using them with advantage. The
claws can’t wield weapons or shields or do anything that
requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic
items or performing the somatic components of a spell.

25

When you drink this blue goo, your skin turns into
a thick gray rubber. For 1 hour, you have resistance to
lightning damage.

26

KEENING VOICE

When you open this potion, a keening wail comes out of
the bottle. When imbibed, this potion gives the drinker’s
vocal cords a magic resonance. As a bonus action, you can
make a ranged attack against a creature within 60 feet of
you, using your Charisma (Performance) bonus for the
attack bonus. The target is unaffected if can’t hear you. On
a hit, the target takes 1d6 thunder damage. The effect of
this potion lasts for 1 hour.

27

KINETIC POP

When poured over a nonmagical weapon, this potion
fills the mundane item with kinetic energy, causing it to
vibrate with anticipation. The next time you hit a creature with the weapon, the energy explodes, doubling the
damage rolled by the weapon’s damage dice. The effects of
this potion end after 1 hour or once the energy explodes.

system gain a boost of furtive energy from the rabbit
spirit, Jipampa. Your pupils dilate and your reflexes
become enhanced. For the next 24 hours you gain a +5
bonus to initiative rolls. Additionally, if a trigger would
allow you to take a reaction, but you have already used
your reaction this round, you can choose to take a second
reaction; using this ability causes the effects of this potion
to end early.

that action. Once you do so, the effects of this potion end.
While the potion is active, you gain the ability to purr like
a cat.

and fills you with fiery strength. The next time you would

number of hit points equal to half the damage you would
have taken. The effects of this potion last for 24 hours or
until you regain hit points in this way.

36

TUNNEL VISION

Drinking this potion causes you to hyperfixate on your
strikes but potentially opens you to counterattacks. The
effects of this potion last for 1 minute. For the duration,
the first time you hit a target with a weapon attack on
each of your turns, it deals an extra 1d12 damage of the
same type. Until the potion’s effects end, you also take a
−2 penalty to AC.

37

RATATAM’S GLOWSKIN ELIXIR

When you drink this potion, your skin begins to shed dim
light in a 10-foot radius around you. As a bonus action,
you can choose to intensify this light—shedding bright
light in a 10-foot radius, and dim light for an additional
10 feet—or diminish the intensity again. Additionally,
you can take an action to produce a flare of blinding light
around you. Each creature within 30 feet of you that can
see must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw
or become blinded for 1 minute. An affected creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. The effects of this
potion last for 8 hours or until you use the flare.

38

DON’T HIT ME JUICE

over you.

BOTTLED BIND

When thrown at a creature you can see within 30 feet
of you, this thick mudlike potion breaks, covering the
creature in tacky glue. The target must succeed on a DC 15

15 Strength check. On a success, the target is no
longer restrained.

41

RESPIRATORY DISTRESS

This potion reacts instantly with air, rapidly expanding
into a 15-foot-radius cloud of irritating gas when exposed.
You can throw it at a point you can see within 60 feet of
you, causing it to break open and release the cloud there.
Each creature within the cloud when it appears must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature spends its reaction coughing and snorting and its
concentration is broken if it was concentrating.

226

42

PUMPKIN PATCH GUARD

When consumed, this warming harvest beverage transforms your head into a Jack-O’-Lantern. From your newly
formed eyes you cast a cone of glowing light, which causes
creatures in a 15-foot cone to be under the effects of the

your body. Anyone who can see you when the hands first
emerge must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or

that are friendly to you have advantage on this save. Additionally, the arms lash out from you, clawing at all other

it, as if by the Mending* spell.

25

LIQUID LOCKPICK

Although frowned upon in many villages, this useful
potion is still sought after by many islanders for both
wholesome and nefarious reasons. You can pour the
potion into a lock, loosening the mechanism inside and
decreasing the DC to pick it by 1d4. Once a lock’s DC is
reduced by this potion, its DC can’t be reduced by another
liquid lockpick potion. The effects of this potion last
for 1 hour.

26

LANGUAGE LORE

This grayish potion tastes like chewed up paper. For 1 hour
after drinking it, you understand the literal meaning of
any spoken language that you hear.

29

27

PIG SNOUT

After drinking this pink pastel potion, there is a brief
uncomfortable transformation, where the imbiber grows
a beautiful, snuffling pig snout. For the next hour, you
become very fond of truffles, perhaps even to the point of
belligerence, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

28

MACHINE OIL

When poured over a machine that is in working condition,
this dark black liquid powers up the device, allowing it to
function as if it were whelmed by a spirit or activated by
the Jolt* spell. The machine stays powered by this potion
for 1 minute.

29

POTION OF SOFT STEPS

When you drink this frothy brew, you float an inch off
the ground and walk on a cushion of air. For the next 10
minutes, you gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks,
and you leave no discernible tracks.

30

LIQUID CAT

This lively swirling concoction transforms and solidifies
into a friendly cat when poured out. The cat serves you
as a familiar, as if from the Find Familiar* spell. The cat
disappears after 24 hours.

TWIN VISION

This potion must be shared with another creature, each of
them ingesting half of the potion. When the second half of
the potion is consumed, the first creature gains the ability
to see through the eyes of the second creature, gaining the
benefits of any special senses that creature has. While seeing
in this way, the first creature is blind with regard to its own
senses. Either creature can use its action to stop shared
vision or reactivate it.” This ability lasts for 8 hours, and it
can’t be used if the creatures are more than 1 mile apart.

32

SPIRIT REPELLENT

This potion can either be imbibed or poured on a 1-foot
square causing the nearby area to become repulsive to
spirits. Any spirit that has a challenge rating of 5 or lower
within 30 feet of you or the square must make a DC 15
Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the spirit is teleported to a random unoccupied space that is 35 feet away
from you or the square, and can’t willingly move to a space
within range for 1 minute. A spirit that hasn’t made this
save must immediately do so if it moves within range,
becoming affected by the repellant for the duration on a
failed save.

234

33

ESSENCE OF THE RIVER SPIRIT

This small, stoppered vial contains a clear liquid that
shimmers with a faint blue light. When the vial is opened,
you can pour the liquid into a small pool of water, such as
a bath or hot spring, transforming it into a healing pool.
A creature that soaks in the pool for at least 10 minutes
regains 4d4 + 4 hit points. The pool loses its magic after 1
hour or once six creatures have benefited from this effect.

34

POTION OF FREEZING

Pouring this grayish blue potion into any liquid will cause
that liquid to freeze solid for 1 hour, after which it begins
to thaw as normal. This effect can freeze no more than a
20-foot cube of liquid.

35

POTION OF ATTUNEMENT

As an action, you can pour a drop of this potion onto a
magic item that requires attunement and drink the rest.
Once you do so, you instantly become attuned to that item.

favorite juice. For the duration, you can breathe underwater. The effects of the potion last for 1 hour.

37

LIQUID DISPEL

When thrown at a creature, object, or magical effect within
30 feet of you, this potion breaks, releasing its contents
on the target. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target
immediately ends.

38

POCKET STOMACH

When imbibed, your stomach temporarily functions as a
bag of holding, allowing you to store any object you can
fit in your mouth inside its extradimensional space. The
effects of this potion last for a 1 hour, after which you
throw up anything consumed.

39

LIQUID ARCANA

The brewer of this potion rolls a d4 to determine the maximum level of the spell slot it can restore. When you drink
it, you immediately regain an expended spell slot of that
level or lower.

40

ARCANE SOLVENT

When this potion is applied to a magic item, any creature
that was attuned to it is no longer attuned. If the item is
being worn or carried by the attuned creature, it can resist
the effects of this potion with a successful DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw.

41

GARDNER’S SOLUTION

When this oily, greenish potion is rubbed on a plant,
the plant instantly grows to full maturity. If the plant
is too big for the space—such as a redwood tree—it will
stop growing once it has reasonably filled the space. If
the potion is imbibed, it does nothing, but it tastes like
maple syrup.

42

POTION OF EXERTION

When you drink this potion, you gain a surge of manic
energy allowing you to take another action this round at
initiative count 1.

43

BREAKFAST IN A BOTTLE

The brewer of this potion rolls a d4 to determine the
number of servings it creates. When poured out, this
liquid quickly forms into an appetizing breakfast, such as
some bread or pancakes. A creature that consumes a serving of it feels satiated for the day, and its exhaustion level
is reduced by 1. It takes 1 minute to consume one serving,
and once a creature benefits from this effect, it can’t do so
again until it finishes a long rest. The food spoils after 24
hours, losing its magic.

potion allows the imbibers to communicate telepathically
across any distance. The effects of this potion last
for 24 hours.

45

POTION OF REPRIEVE

When imbibed, this potion offers temporary relief from
an ill effect. For the next hour, you gain the benefit of an
effect of your choice from the Greater Restoration* spell.
When this potion’s effects end, you lose the chosen benefit, causing the ill effect to return.

46

UNCANNY FOCUS

For 1 minute after imbibing this purplish liquid, you
have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to
maintain concentration on spells. In addition, becoming
incapacitated doesn’t cause you to lose concentration on
a spell.

47

MEDITATIVE TRANCE

This violet colored potion smells like lavender and citrus.
The next time you take a short rest after ingesting it, you
enjoy a deep, dreamless sleep, granting you the benefits of
a long rest, even if you already benefited from a long rest
in the past 24 hours.

236

48

POTION OF HOLISTIC WELLNESS

When you uncork this potion of scintillating liquid, your
senses are calmed with the smell of vanilla and honey
along with a warm spring breeze. When imbibed, you feel
like your whole soul is embraced in a loving hug, causing you to regain 4d8 + 4 hit points, and removing any
conditions affecting you, excluding the grappled, prone, or
restrained condition.

49

SHARP MIND

When you drink this potion, your mind becomes charged
with magical energy. For the next 8 hours, you gain a +2
bonus to Intelligence saving throws, and you gain resistance to psychic damage. In addition, you can devour
whole tomes of text, reading 10 times faster than normal.

50

MIND OVER MIGHT

When consumed, this chalky elixir turns an intellectual
scholar into an athlete. For the next 24 hours, you can use
your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice), in
place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, when making
Strength (Athletics) and Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks. You
also gain proficiency in those skills for the duration, if you
don’t already have it.

SIMULACRUM ELIXIR

When consumed, this numbing concoction sends you
into a deep sleep. When you awake, your mind has taken
over a perfect clone of yourself. The clone appears to be
the same as you in every way, but it has half of your hit
point maximum and is formed without any equipment
other than mundane clothes. Otherwise, the clone uses all
of your statistics, except that it is a construct. The clone
lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it
never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain
expended spell slots.
While the clone exists, your original body stays in a
constant deep sleep, where it requires no nourishment, but
it can still suffer damage as normal. The clone lasts until
you dismiss it or it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it
disappears in a cloud of butterflies. When it disappears,
your mind returns to your original body.

52

HIDDEN HAND

When consumed, this grainy potion heightens your senses
and gives you a sunken feeling of untapped strength. For
the next 24 hours, you gain telekinetic powers as if you were
under the effects of the Telekinesis* spell.

53

LAST RESORT

When this potion is downed, a crystalline cocoon begins
forming around you. The cocoon becomes fully formed at
the start of your next turn, and you can’t be contacted or
interacted with in any way. The cocoon is immune to all
damage, and it can’t be moved or destroyed by any means
short of a wish spell. While in the cocoon, you are in stasis
and don’t need to eat or breathe. The cocoon lasts between
1 hour and 4 decades. Roll on the table below to determine
the measurement of time for the effect, from hours to
decades. Then roll a d4 to determine the exact amount of
time the cocoon exists.

ELIXIR OF ECHOES

When you drink this potion, you gain the ability to cast
a spell that was cast by another creature within the last
minute. The spell has to have been cast within 100 feet of
you, and you must be aware that the spell was cast. Once
imbibed, you can cast the copied spell once within the
next minute, without expending a spell slot or material
components. If the spell requires a saving throw or spell
attack roll, you use the DC and attack bonus of the creature
that originally cast the spell.

55

BLESSING OF THE MOON SPIRIT

After drinking this potion, which glows like a full moon,
you gain a strange and wondrous affinity for the moon’s
light. This potion’s effects are permanent.
While moonlight touches you, you can use a bonus
action to expend three hit dice. You can use this ability
once per long rest.
When you first consume this potion, your hit point
maximum is increased by 2d10. This doesn’t count against
the number of potions you can have affecting you at once.

56

BOWARK’S BOMBASTIC BEER

This potion was discovered by accident by the great brewmaster, Bowark. Unsealing it fills the room with a strong
scent of hops and yeasty goodness. When consumed this
beer gives you a warm euphoric calm that makes you feel
like everything will be alright. Until this potion’s effects
end, you can choose to reroll any ability check, attack roll,
or saving throw you make. You can reroll in this way a
total of 7 times before the potion wears off.

57

UNIFIED MIGHT

When consumed, this potion produces a burning sensation that fills your body, leaving you with newfound intellectual and physical strength. For the next hour, two ability
scores of your choice increase to 25.

58

UMI’S POWERFUL UNDERTOW

This potent elixir allows the drinker to enhance their
aquatic spells with the ocean’s wrath. For the next hour,
when you cast a spell that produces or manipulates water
in some capacity, the spell is cast as if using a spell slot of
one level higher. Additionally, spells that use water to deal
damage to a creature or object, deal an extra 2d12 bludgeoning damage.
Alternatively, you can throw the potion into an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you, breaking the glass
and summoning three water elementals in the nearest
unoccupied spaces. These creatures are under your control
until destroyed.

same bonus action to consume it, you can immediately
make a melee weapon attack, cast a spell that targets only
one creature or object, or move up to your speed.

ELIXIR OF OMNIMIND

This pale blue potion smells like ozone. When you drink
it, your mind expands, and you gain a brief but exceptional
capacity to comprehend the vast complexities of the arcane.
For the next minute, you can concentrate on two spells at
the same time. If you are forced to make a Constitution
saving throw to maintain your concentration, you must
make a separate saving throw for each spell.

your thoughts into the bubble, where they manifest as
illusory but silent words or images (your choice), which
anyone can see.

glow with magic. When the food is tasted, it magically
gives the taster their own personal version of the ultimate
culinary experience.

VOCAL STRANGER

Once imbibed, you can perfectly mimic the speech of a
person you’re not familiar with. If you can’t think of a
person you’ve never met, you instead mimic a random
voice. The effects of the potion last for 1 hour.

BEARD BREW

Drinking this fuzzy liquid gives the sensation of wool
rubbing against your entire body. When consumed, you
instantly grow facial hair, even if you would not normally
be able to do so. The style of facial hair is random, and
it stays on your face until shaven off. This doesn’t count
against the number of potions you can have affecting your
body at once.

the next 24 hours, while the sun is out you regain 1 hit

MUSICAL MIXER

When uncorked, this silvery elixir produces beautiful,
ethereal music for 1 hour as it slowly evaporates.

11

STINK BREW

It stinks and now so do you! After drinking this potion,
all other creatures within 15 feet of you must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be unable to willingly
move closer to you for the duration. A creature that hasn’t
yet made this save must immediately do so when it
moves within 15 feet of you. The effects of the potion
last 1d4 rounds.

and your Strength and Dexterity become 10, unless those
scores are already less than 10.

fingers. You can change the color of the paints at will, and
they never seem to run out. The effects of the potion last
for 8 hours.

AUDIO ODDITY

When opened, this embarrassing and noisy potion sounds
like a man sobbing. When consumed, this potion strangely
mutes the sound produced by any spell cast by the imbiber
for the next 1 hour.

16

HINDSIGHT

A well-known potion amongst investigators and
merchants, this thick brew acquires special insight on an
object when poured over it. The only downside is that you
must then lick the brew off the object to obtain any of
this information. When poured and then licked off, the
potion reveals a minor but useful bit of information about
the object.

17

SUPER SINGING

When consumed, this potion tastes as if it were a freshly
brewed tea with the perfect amount of honey mixed in.
For the next hour, you are unable to speak without singing,
and you have advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks
using your voice.

18

FLUFFPLUM TONIC

This nearly weightless liquid grants to drinkers the attributes of a dandelion, allowing them to float safely to the
ground when falling and be easily carried by the wind. For
the next hour, you are under the effects of the Feather
Fall* spell and weigh no more than 1 pound.

19

MERRIMENT

Is this just booze? For the next hour, you become incredibly intoxicated. For the duration, you gain expertise in a
skill of your choice, which means your proficiency bonus is
doubled for any ability check you make with it. Until this
effect ends, all ability checks you make that don’t use the
chosen skill are made with disadvantage.

20

BUBBLE MESSAGE

As part of the bonus action to consume this potion, you
speak a message and hiccup a bubble, which magically
contains the message inside it. You then describe a creature
you are familiar with and the bubble floats to that creature,
traveling at a speed of 1 mile per hour, and then pops. The
bubble pops early if it takes any damage. When the bubble
pops, it releases the contained message in your voice.

a 20-foot cube, the potion has no effect.

You are filled with intense feelings of confusion before

Unseen Servant* spell and lasts for 1 hour.

HSIREBBIG

This bitter potion grants you a special form of speech that

comprehend languages fail to decipher this speech. The
effects of this potion last 24 hours.

SKY SWIMMING

After drinking this potion, you feel the sudden and
unpleasant feeling of wearing soaking-wet clothing. For the
next 10 minutes, you gain a flying speed of 15 feet and can
hover, but it looks and feels as if you’re swimming through
the sky. While flying in this way, you must also obey the
rules for underwater combat.

feet, but only while holding hands with all other creatures
that partook of the potion.

you grow a 6-foot-long prehensile tail, which takes a form
decided by the GM. The tail can be used as if it were a
third arm and can easily support your own weight. The tail
lasts for 1d12 days before falling off.

36

MOVE A THING

When poured over an object that weighs 500 pounds
or less, it begins to weigh lighter and lighter. The object
weighs up to 1d100 pounds less at the start of every hour
until it weighs exactly 10 pounds. It remains weighing
10 pounds for 1 week, after which the effects of this
potion fade.

37

GOBBLE GUNK

This unappealing potion allows the imbiber to eat whatever they can fit in their mouth with no ill effect—metal,
poison, seawater: you name it, you eat it. The effects of this
potion last 1 hour. Any magical objects consumed in this
way are hurled back up after the end of the hour.

38

Whenever you would fall prone, you instead stand up as if
an invisible force kept you that way. Even by choice, you
cannot go prone. The effects of this potion last 10 days.

40

LUNAR ELIXIR

When poured out, this silvery liquid rapidly expands and
coats the surrounding area, creating a chalky white sheen
across everything it touches. For the next 8 hours, gravity
in a 20-foot-radius, 300-foot-high cylinder centered on the
potion is like the moon’s gravity. The jump distance for all
creatures inside the cylinder is tripled, and falling damage
taken inside the cylinder is halved.

41

LIFETIME SUPPLY

When consumed, this potion causes your hair to grow at
an accelerated rate. Roll 1d4 + 2 and multiply it by 100 to
find out how many feet of hair you grow. After 1 minute,
the potion wears off and all your hair falls out.

SPIRIT SWEETS

This bitter concoction tastes and smells horrible to physical beings, yet couldn’t taste more delicious to spirits,
many of which would trade quite a bit for a sip of the
brew. A spirit with a challenge rating of 8 or lower that
consumes this potion becomes drunk and happy for 1d4
days. Alternatively, the potion can be poured out, attracting spirits with a challenge rating of 2 or lower that are
within 1 mile. When poured out, the potion attracts spirits
for 8 hours or until it is consumed.

45

A NEW LOOK

When consumed, this unassuming elixir magically transforms your head into a random anthropomorphic animal,
such as a horse, panda, pig, or raccoon. This effect lasts
until removed, as if it were a curse. This doesn’t count
against the number of potions you can have affecting your
body at once.

46

SHADOW PUPPET

Once consumed, this potion gives sentience to your
shadow. The shadow starts to act independently of you but
is still bound to your body. It has its own emotions and
personality but can’t interact with the world in any way
beyond what a normal shadow could. The effects of this
potion last until removed, as if it were a curse. This doesn’t
count against the number of potions you can have affecting your body at once.

47

OBJECT EMBODIMENT

When you drink this metallic potion, your body twists and
alters into an object of your choice, as if by the true polymorph spell. This effect doesn’t require your concentration
and ends after 1 hour.

PHOENIX ELIXIR

When imbibed, this elixir burns your throat and ignites
an ember within you. For 24 hours, you are immune to fire
damage. When the potion’s magic finally fades, the fire
inside of you burns intensely from within, consuming you
in flames and turning your body to ash. 1 hour later you
appear in the nearest bonfire, reborn anew. All objects and
clothing that were on your person when you were turned
to ash are left by your original body.

You gain the ability to cast one random spell of 6th level
or lower, without expending a spell slot. This spell uses a
save DC of 17 and a spell attack bonus of +9. The effects of
this potion last until the spell is cast. This doesn’t count
against the number of potions you can have affecting your
body at once.

ILLUSION IN A BOTTLE

When this potion is poured out, an illusion of your choice
appears in its space, as if by the Major Image* spell.
A creature that uses its action to examine the image can
determine that it is an illusion with a successful DC 18

NEW LIFE

The brewer of this potion chooses the likeness of a humanoid that they are familiar with. When imbibed, you take on
the illusionary form of the chosen creature. This illusory
disguise is perfect in every way and matches both the creature’s visage and its voice. Only creatures with the ability
to detect magic or see through illusions (as with truesight)
can discern this disguise. The effects of this potion last for
7 years or until removed, as if it were a curse. This doesn’t
count against the number of potions you can have affecting your body at once.

MIND TRANSFER

When imbibed, this acrid elixir loosens your soul from
your body and prepares it for transfer. The first time you
are touched by a creature after consuming this potion, your
mind and soul transfer into that creature’s body. While
inhabiting the creature’s body, you can force it to make a
contested Intelligence or Wisdom check (you both choose
which ability to use) at the start of each of its turns. If you
succeed, you gain total control over the creature until the
start of its next turn. While your mind and soul are away,
your body is left unconscious. If the creature dies while
your mind and soul are still inside it, you also die. You
inhabit the creature’s body for 1 hour, until you dismiss
the effect as an action, or until the creature is targeted by a
Dispel Evil and Good* spell.

54

55

SPIRITUAL REBUKE

When poured, this dark elixir stains the earth and creates
a 10-foot cube that is void of the island’s magic, as if it
were under the effects of the Antimagic Field* spell This
effect lasts for 1 year.

56

NEWLY FOUND MAGIC

When consumed, you feel a rush of magical inspiration
flow through you. You instantly learn a random 3rd-level
spell. You can cast it without expending a spell slot, and
once you do so, you can’t cast it in this way again until you
finish a long rest. This potion’s effect is permanent, and it
doesn’t count against the number of potions you can have
affecting you at once.

UPS-A-DAISY

When poured over a creature or object, this creamy elixir
instantly awakens the target, as if by the Awaken* spell.
The awakened creature remains charmed by you for 1 year,
instead of 30 days.

CRAFTER’S BREW

The crafter’s brew can be added to any larger container
of water or a small body of water to create an enchanting
bath. The first nonmagical object submerged in the water
for at least 1 minute gains a permanent magical effect.
This effect is random and powerful enough that the item’s
rarity should be considered uncommon or higher.

58

DANCING FEET

After drinking this potion, you no longer walk or run—
now you dance. Going from one place to another is no
longer a mundane trudge, a shuffling expression of ennui.
How you get from point A to point B is now a dazzling
dance performance. From smooth, elven waltzes, to
Nakudama hops and gyrations, to the interpretive dance
forms of the dara, you explore them all. Your stylish moves
increase your walking speed by 10 feet, give you a +5 bonus
to Charisma (Performance) checks that involve dancing,
and grant you proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if
you don’t already have it. This lasts until you dismiss the
potion’s effects as an action.

248

59

CHICKEN CHASER

When you drink this potion, your hair turns dark red (if
you have any), and you gain the ability to speak with chickens permanently, as if by the Speak with Animals* spell.
Additionally, you can crow a sacred and thunderous cackle
that summons 100 chickens in a 20-foot radius centered
on you. These chickens appear running from a distance,
digging out from the ground below, and falling from the
sky in a veritable tsunami of flapping, clucking poultry.
Each creature in the area (excluding you) must make a DC
19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 30d6 slashing damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. Once you’ve summoned the chickens in this way, you
can’t do so again. This doesn’t count against the number of
potions you can have affecting your body at once.

60

DISAPPEARING ACT

When consumed, your body vanishes along with all the
items you were wearing or carrying, and your sentience is
transferred into a random object within 100 miles of you.

HERO’S JOURNEY
BOON SYSTEM
he Hero’s Journey Boon System is a mechanical tool for GM’s to use as a reward for character development and great roleplaying. It reminds both the GM and the players to pay attention to those iconic moments when a critical choice transforms a character’s development toward or away from a certain personality trait or archetype.

To symbolize this change in a character’s development over the course of an adventure, a Hero’s Boon gives a mechanical
bonus that allows a GM to mark that character’s moment of transformation in a palpable way.

The System
A Hero's Journey Boon is a unique ability granted to adventurers by the GM as a reward for demonstrating character growth
and depth through their actions and roleplaying. Similar to the inspiration system, there is no specific trigger for a player to
earn a Hero's Boon; instead, it is up to the GM to determine if a specific story beat aligns with the criteria for one of the Hero's
Journey Boons. If the GM feels that this moment had weight in the story and was deserving of a boon they can reward the
character for their actions.
As a reward system, the boon invites a player to really engage with their character’s personality and how they develop over
time. It also creates a dynamic between the Game Master and the player to co-create amazing story moments. It rewards players who put in that little bit of extra effort playing their character to the fullest, and it gives the GM a way to pay off compelling situations that the player character explores.

249

Developing Characters in Obojima
While the setting of Obojima allows for a traditional D&D
experience, complete with dungeon delving, fighting
monsters, and getting piles of loot, the genre of Obojima is
more of a fairytale where an adventurer tries to solve interactions with mysterious creatures rather than slay them.
If played according to its genre, Obojima delivers a deeper
roleplaying experience, and to get that, it's helpful if players
are emotionally invested in their character, are clear on who
their character is, and understand what motivates them.

Before Character Creation
Character creation and your Session Zero are times to slow
down and savor the joy of creating something from nothing.
Help your players invent a character with room to grow and
change—the potential to find their true power or to lose
their way and fall from grace.
To get your players thinking about where their character is developmentally and where their personality could
go or how their values could shift during the adventure,
ask them some of the following questions before or during
character creation:

What does your character fear more than anything else?
What does your character desire above all other things?
What obstacle or challenge would your character love to
overcome?
What does your character value the most?
Does your character have a secret?
Does your character have a long term goal or quest that
they want to achieve?
What is your character’s greatest strength?
What is their greatest flaw?
Based on all the information from the above questions,
pick three words that best describe your character.
Think about your character at Level 1 compared to level
10. How are they different and how are they similar?
These questions will get your players thinking about
the inner workings of their character and how they might
change over the course of the game, they will also give you
a host of ideas about how to weave a story in such a way
that it gives the player plenty of chances to roleplay their

250

character by tempting their desires and challenging their
values, for better or worse.
Use this information about their characters to imagine story
situations that tempt them, call them to action, rile them up,
or force them to face a fear. Doing so will tailor make your
stories to get the most epic roleplaying from your players.
Boons = Change
Hero's Boons are designed to inspire and acknowledge the
challenges faced by our protagonists. Character development like this can stem from various aspects, such as the
sacrifice of personal desires, experiencing the deterioration
of a friendship, or discovering new love. When these stories
reach their climactic moments, a GM can bestow a Hero’s
Boon as a reward.
Character’s don’t always have to grow in a direction that
we usually associate with heroism. A character can also
become more miserly, craven, skittish, stubborn, and recalcitrant as well, and a GM should reward a player who roleplays a character slipping into cowardice as much as a player
who roleplays a courageous one.

Here are some examples of
character evolutions:
◊ Tamago changes from a sulky, timid kid who
is resisting change into a hero who learns
self-confidence and responsibility. These
traits and more allow her to face the changes
back in the Physical Realm.
◊ Nami moves from a kind and gentle local
leader to a world-shaping messianic figure.
◊ Kimo goes from a naive witch, who during her
quest to find independence, loses her confidence
and regains it again through discovering the
value of community and friendship.

Giving Hero’s
Journey Boons
During a roleplaying session, there will be moments—both
great and small—where a player does something to demonstrate their adventurer’s personality, show their struggles,
and move them along their path of growth as a character.
Hero’s Boons reward these moments of roleplaying, fostering a deeper engagement from their players with the story.
The GM can award a boon when they feel like a player has
earned one. It could be for showing their character’s struggle to resist temptation or how a character faces a fear and
finds an inner courage they didn’t know they possessed.

Negative Boons

ENVY

Although all boons have an ability that is generally net
positive for the player using them, due to the connotation and reason for having it, some boons can leave a bad
impression on the player and those around them. These
boons can serve as physical reminders of the choices the
player has made and can push them towards restoration
of their character or serve as a tool to plunge them into a
darker character development further.

Characteristics: Someone whose insecurities or past trauma
have driven them to desire what others have. This person
covets something so much that they’d be willing to do
anything to get it, even at the expense of their loved ones.
Boon Ability: Choose an ally creature that you can see and
gain proficiency in a skill they have proficiency in. This
effect lasts for 1 hour. While you have proficiency in the
chosen skill, the ally you copied it from has disadvantage in
all checks that use that skill.

FEARFUL
As a word of caution, not all boons will be
perfect for your party of players. Boons such
as Selfishness allow players to affect other
players without being able to respond or having
much if any agency in the interaction. We
highly recommend communication and careful
consideration before giving a boon like this.

Removing a Boon
Players might lose a boon if they don’t hold onto the change
that got them the boon in the first place. If you notice a
player acting uncharacteristically you can remove the boon
from them. Alternatively, the removal of a boon or replacement of a boon can serve as a powerful moment in the
story—a character who drops the gold to save their friend
at the risk of their own life might lose the Selfishness boon
while gaining the Heroic boon in one fell swoop.

BOONS
Below is a list of Hero’s Journey Boons that you can give
your players. The Hero’s Journey Boons are listed in alphabetical order.

ACCEPTANCE
Characteristics: Those who have gone through a deep and
harrowing journey and came to face a truth so difficult that
it hurt to accept it—and yet they did it anyways and eventually came to peace with that truth.
Boon Ability: When making a skill check you can choose
to add a +5 bonus to the roll. Once you use this boon, you
can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Characteristics: Through one impactful moment or a slow
build over time, this person has been stricken with a deep
and overwhelming fear. This fear now clouds their judgment and overrides their emotions—it controls their life.
Boon Ability: If you are hit by an attack while an ally creature is within 5 feet of you, you can choose to have the ally
take the damage instead of you. Once you use this boon,
you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

FORGIVENESS
Characteristics: By accepting their emotions, this person can
let go of their anger and frustrations, forgiving those who’ve
wronged them and rekindling the damaged relationship.
Boon Ability: When you are hit by an attack, you can
choose to cause all subsequent attacks made by the creature
to be made at disadvantage. This effect lasts until the end
of your next turn. Once you use this boon, you can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest.

HATE
Characteristics: A person full of hate is blind to the effects
their actions can have. To fulfill their vendetta they’re willing to alienate and even hurt those close to them.
Boon Ability: When you make an attack roll or skill check
you can choose to change the roll to a 20. If you choose to
do this all Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom checks are
made at disadvantage for the next hour. Once you use this
boon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

HEROIC
Characteristics: A person who puts fear behind themselves and stands up in a time of need to the very best they
can. Whether they fail or not they give everything they can
to do what is right.
Boon Ability: When you would fail a Wisdom, Charisma,
or Intelligence saving throw, you can instead choose to
succeed. Once you use this boon, you can’t do so again until
you finish a long rest.

251

MERCY

SELFISHNESS

Characteristics: Those with the power to deal out judgment
onto others but have the compassion and understanding to
hold back.

Characteristics: Someone whose actions have worsened
the lives of those closest to them. A character that, when
they could have done the right thing, chose the path for the
betterment of themselves over others.

Boon Ability: When you make an attack that would drop
a creature below zero hit points, you can choose to forgo
the damage, making a Charisma skill check with advantage
instead. Once you use this boon, you can’t do so again until
you finish a long rest.

SHAME

Boon Ability: When you take damage, you can choose to
regain 2 hit points for each ally you have within 30 feet of
you. When you do so, each ally suffers a number of Necrotic
damage equal to the hit points you recovered. Once you use
this boon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

SELFLESS

Characteristics: Devastated by a mistake they’ve made or a
circumstance forced on them, this person now hates a part
of themselves. This thing feels as if it is out in the open for
all to see, and they can’t stand the thought of others judging
them for it.
Boon Ability: As a bonus action, all creatures within 60 feet
of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be unable
to look in your direction until the end of your next turn. The
DC for this boon is equal to 10 + your level. Once you use
this boon, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Making Your Own Boons
This list above is not comprehensive and we
encourage you to craft your own unique boons
for your personal games.

Characteristics: Above all else, this person puts those
around them before themselves. They wish to help the
people they care the most about, sometimes to the detriment of their well-being.
Boon Ability: On your turn, you can forgo your action,
allowing a character that can see or hear you to take an
action or move. Once you use this boon, you can’t do so
again until you finish a long rest.

Friends
& Foes

T

his chapter describes many of the strange, charming, mischievous, and dangerous creatures and folk that call Obojima
home. Read on to find the following:
◊ Information about a special kind of NPC called a companion spirit.
◊ GM guidance on creating antagonists in your game that have that unique Obojima flavor.
◊ A bestiary with rules information for 60 new monsters and NPCs.

Companion Spirits
Companion spirits are sentient minor spirits who gravitate
toward people. They can vary in shape—from animals to
plants and fungi or even candles—though their physical
forms are usually no bigger than a dog. Companions range
in personality, and while most are kind and adorable—much
like our pets—they can also be mischievous, stubborn, and
demanding. Due to their simplistic nature, they typically
have a self-serving vision of the world—they like what
they like, and don’t like what they don’t like—but there are
those companion spirits who can be a bit more thoughtful,
erudite, and wise.

Since companions are NPCs that are controlled
by the GM, they are versatile story tools that
the GM can use at any time. Companions can
serve to foster character connection to the world.
They are also a great way to pull characters into
unique side quests. They can even become the
main focus of an entire adventure. They can also
help buff a party that is in over its head, or give
a clueless party some crucial bits of advice when
they’re completely stuck.

It’s important to remember that companions are not familiars. Though they tend to favor their chosen people, each one has
a will of its own, with quirks, goals, and desires, and they are free to come and go as they please.

Companion Goals
Every companion on Obojima has a goal that it wishes to accomplish. Some are satisfied with accomplishing one and others
can have multiple goals. Unlike typical familiars, companions are not bound to a character, rather they are known to seek out
adventurers who have the skills they believe will help them achieve their goal. A small hermit crab companion might appeal
to a perceptive adventurer to help them find a new shell or
an awakened cat might ask a rogue or a strong fighter to help
Should a player character help a companion spirit
them get through a locked door. It is as if a companion spirit
achieve its goal, it may earn them a special boon
can sense who has the certain skill or ability they need to help
(see Chapter 249: Hero’s Journey Boons)
them achieve their goal.

Along with their goals, companions also have desires which may conflict with their goals. For example, a fire spirit companion
might have a goal to be free of being stuck within the hearth of a village inn, cooking food for travelers and heating up kettles
of water, but it may also desire the wood that is being brought to it by the innkeeper to be for consumption and not want to
leave its steady supply of tasty lumber to burn—a real quandary!

COMPANION TYPES
Animated Object
Spirit
Unique among spirits are those, that for one reason or
another, are drawn to possess inanimate objects. Though
sages remain uncertain why spirits choose certain objects, it
is widely agreed that spirits appear to prefer items that are
meaningful to people. A spirit might linger in one object,
or move from one to the next the way a hermit crab moves
from shell to shell over the course of its life.
Objects possessed by spirits become animated, allowing
the spirit to interact with the Physical Realm. Once a spirit
has chosen an object to be its vessel, it regards it as part of
itself and won’t possess other objects.
The table below has a list of examples of forms an animated
object spirit might take. Feel free to create your own.

Beast Spirit
Beast spirits may or may not be the most common type of companion. Many
household pets are treated as though they were spirits, and some spirits prefer to
remain anonymous to their chosen person. It is perhaps the ambiguous nature of
their presence that has led many Obojimans to regard pets with a semi-reverence.

Flying Beast Spirit
Unlike their land-bound counterparts, flying spirits tend to keep a degree of distance from settlements, while not altogether
rejecting them. People are fascinating, and flying spirits prefer to watch from a distance. It’s not uncommon for a person to
claim they are being watched by the same owl or followed by the same chicken every day. When the time is right, the spirit
will reveal itself to their chosen person.

Elemental Spirit
It’s easy to look past these enigmatic spirits, whose elemental nature allows them to blend in with their surroundings, given
the right environment. There is a theory among those who study spirits, that claims elemental spirits are likely the first to
cross from their realm into the physical. There are probably more of them than we know about, existing as part of and on
behalf of nature.

Spectral Spirit
These mysterious spirits are unique among their kind that
dwell in the Physical Realm because they have rejected
the notion of a fixed physical form. Rather, they prefer the
fluidity of taking on any form or no form even if it limits
their ability to interact with the world around them.
Spectral spirits take on the form of an amorphous wisp. A
spectral spirit might shift its form, taking on different shapes
and colors to suit its mood.

Flora Spirit
Spirits of this variety can resemble all kinds of foliage. They
get a form as they enter the Physical Realm, growing into it
as though they were actual flora. They might be mistaken
for a plant or mushroom at a cursory glance, but anyone
paying attention will notice that they have arms, legs, and
expressive little faces.
Flora spirits tend to see the plants or fungus that resemble
them as kindred, and they are most often found tending the
places where they appeared. However, some leave their familiar soil, venturing forth to roam the island.

might take. Feel free to create your own.

THINKING ABOUT
ANTAGONISTS
Every adventure wants a compelling antagonist—a primary
obstacle that stands in the heroes’ way. When done
correctly, they can become one of the most memorable
elements of your game. Left unhindered, an antagonist
would harm or at least disrupt the lives of the heroes and
the people and places they care about. Antagonists are often
characters with ambitions that drive them to stand at odds
with the heroes. These characters are typically described as
villains with self-serving aims and a willingness to harm
others to get what they want. Some antagonists are forces
of nature or supernatural phenomena that don’t necessarily
act with malicious intent, but are dangerous nonetheless.
As you approach crafting the antagonist of your adventure,
keep in mind that they exist so that the heroes will have to
confront them in some manner, and likely as the centerpiece
of the adventure’s climax. To help make that showdown one
for the books, consider the following questions:

What drives the heroes to thwart
the antagonist?
The heroes might have been hired to do it, or it might just
be the right thing to do. But if it’s personal, the heroes’
victory over the antagonist is sure to be more meaningful
and therefore more memorable.

What makes the antagonist unique?
Find ways to make them stick out in the players’ minds.
If the antagonist is a character, what peculiarities and
affectations do they have? Do they have an interesting
manner of speaking or wield an odd form of magic? If an
aspect of nature is the looming threat, how is its presence
felt or foretold?

If the antagonist is a character, do they
deserve empathy?
An antagonist who we might empathize with can influence how players see them, and consequently how they’ll
approach dealing with them. Truly brutal, cruel, and
monstrous antagonists might exist to have the heroes kick
their teeth in. However, if you can create an antagonist who
demands empathy despite their actions, you leave room for
that character’s transformation or even redemption. This
often requires the heroes to learn more about the antagonist—to humanize them—in order to understand why they
do what they do. See the table on this page for some inspiration for your antagonist’s motivation.

Motivations for Antagonistic
Behavior (d12)

The Spectrum of Antagonists
One of the great joys in RPGs is when adventurers turn an
enemy into a friend. This complicated relationship is rich,
and the ongoing encounters with these characters can be
quite rewarding for players. That doesn’t mean that all
antagonists are pals to be, however, and there’s no guarantee that the players will have an appetite for friendship
once an enemy crosses them. But as you plan your ongoing
adventures, it might be helpful to think about your antagonists as existing on a spectrum. There are the antagonists
that aren’t all bad–the lovable scoundrels, the knights loyal
to masters who may be unworthy of them, the reckless
wizards in over their heads, the dumb lunks who don’t
know their own strength, etc. But then there are the true
baddies–the villainous scum whose defeat is so sweet for
the players.

267

The way this dynamic often plays out in stories is that
the protagonist first encounters what they believe to be the
villain, only to later discover the existence of the true big
bad. In an RPG, that discovery is a chance to recontextualize how the players regard the other antagonists–the ones
who aren’t so bad by comparison. These characters might
simply have goals that are at odds with the characters due
to circumstance or misunderstanding. You might have an
antagonist who the characters get along with, but they are
sworn to an enemy. There could be a cursed warrior who
has been tasked with capturing the characters in exchange
for a cure. The options are limitless, but the point is that
the evolving nature of the relationship that develops
between them and the characters is a wonderful opportunity for satisfying storytelling.

Consider the Outcome
What happens when the heroes overcome the antagonist
or at least thwart them? Often, we think of a large boss
fight as the end of an adventure, but that’s just the climax
of the action. It’s the fallout from the heroes’ actions that
will serve as the final note of an adventure. It’s a beat that
is too easily rushed. However, it’s worth thinking about
what “winning” looks like. Let the conclusion linger a bit—
it was hard won, afterall.
Below is a breakdown of approaches to handling your
antagonist at the conclusion of an adventure once the
heroes have overcome them.

Straightforward
This is the “we did it!” ending. Often, players just want to
roll initiative, crack skulls, and feel good about the skulls
they cracked along the way. They know that the antagonist
is defeated and all will be right on Obojima. If that works
for your players, there’s no need to complicate it. Onward to
the medal ceremony!

Bittersweet
This is the “at what cost?” ending. With victory comes
lasting scars. Heroes might be forever changed. Evidence of
a great battle might mark the landscape for years to come.
The player might be left with mixed feelings about what it
took to stop the antagonist. Perhaps only a few NPCs truly
understand what was sacrificed to get there.

268

Redemption
This is the “I’m a good guy now” ending. There’s no help
for an antagonist who does villainous things simply
because they are evil by nature. However, there are all
sorts of reasons for an antagonist to stand in the way of
the heroes, which means it’s possible that, with the right
words and/or actions, the heroes could actually turn the
antagonist to their cause.

False Redemption
This is the “you always knew who I was” ending. The antagonist betrays the heroes only after convincing them they’d
changed. It’s a great way to propel a single adventure’s
antagonist into the role of a campaign’s big bad.

Anticlimax
This is the “we’ll meet again!” ending. The outcome is not
conclusive, and it results in the antagonist and heroes
going their separate ways. Though the heroes might have
thwarted the antagonist’s scheme, there are sure to be more
confrontations down the road. Like the false redemption
ending, this is a powerful way to conclude an adventure
with the promise of a larger campaign.

Reversal
This is “the bad guy was right” ending. It’s possible that the
heroes overcome the antagonist only to realize that perhaps
their own actions were misguided, and that they were on
the wrong side of the conflict. It’s a tricky one to pull off, as
it runs the risk of feeling like a moral bait and switch. If the
reversal is something you think your players would enjoy,
it’s best to leave signposts in the adventure to seed doubt
in the heroes. That way, the outcome is more likely to come
across as plausible.

CREATURES

Below you will find a list of creatures that can be found throughout the island of Obojima. These creatures are listed in
alphabetical order.

Acorn Crab
Although their name implies a small, nut-sized creature,
acorn crabs are enormous land crabs that have a penchant
for climbing into trees and dining on acorns. They are territorial and will defend their trees, sometimes falling from
great heights and using their shells as battering rams to
smash interlopers far below.

Great Heights. When the acorn crab falls from a height
of 10 feet or higher, it can make a Slam attack at the end
of the fall. When it does so, it takes no falling damage.

Actions
Multiattack. The acorn crab makes two Pinch attacks.
Pinch. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, plus an
extra 3 (1d6) damage for every 10 feet the acorn crab
fell before the attack.

269

Akaobata
Akaobata are hoarders and covetors of truths and secrets.
Reveling in the power and delight brought from knowing
some unknown truth about another person—especially if
that secret causes great consternation.
Though the stories of the Akaobata aren’t well known
among the islanders, those who do know of the spirit will
advise you to keep out of the affairs of such a creature—
Failing to do so will have you engrossed by its cursed games,
unaware of how to escape.

Akaobata’s Gift
Akaobata is said to approach a creature and offer a gift in
exchange for an answer to their question. These gifts are
rumored to be as simple as a meal in desperate times, or as
lavish as a priceless piece of art. The gift however should
not be of concern to the creature whom the Akaobata has

Incorporeal Movement. The Akaobata can move
through other creatures and objects as if they were
difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it
ends its turn inside an object.
Limited Magic Immunity. The Akaobata can’t be
affected or detected by spells of 6th level or lower
unless it wishes to be. It has advantage on saving
throws against all other spells and magical effects.

270

Cursed Touch. Melee Spell Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) psychic damage, and it
must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target’s emotions are overwhelmed with fear,
hate, sorrow, confusion, or regret. When a creature fails
this saving throw, the Akaobata becomes emboldened
until the end of the turn, gaining access to its bonus
action options.

Bonus Actions
The following bonus actions can only be taken by the
Akaobata while it is emboldened.
Fleeting Strengths. The Akaobata chooses a creature
it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed
on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be cursed by the
Akaobata’s intrusive magics. This magical curse causes
the target to lose proficiency in one saving throw or
skill of the Akaobata’s choice. The curse lasts until it is
lifted by a Remove Curse* spell or similar magic.
Levitate. The Akaobata casts Mass Levitate (save DC
16), requiring no material components. Its spellcasting
ability for this spell is Charisma.
Power of Whispers. The Akaobata chooses up to two
creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target
must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or
take 9 (1d8 + 5) psychic damage and become Restrained
until the end of its next turn.

parleyed with, but rather its question. As for most, the
question of the nefarious spirit is often unanswerable, and
the Akaobata will only accept the truth.
The bargain must be honored if a deal is struck with
an Akaobata. If the deal is broken, the consequences can
be disturbing.

Broken Deal
If a creature is unable to answer the Akaobata’s question, the
spirit will haunt the deal breaker until its side of the bargain
is fulfilled — a process the Akaobata enjoys more than
anything else. These haunts have started with minor pestering and stalking, to devious tricks and dangerous actions.

In Death
If an Akaobata has struck a bargain, until that bargain is
met, death on the physical realm is only temporary— Over
time it will eventually return to its gravesite—a process that
can take days or even months. Once returned, it seeks out
the fulfillment of its unfulfilled bargains, often reinvigorated by actions one has taken to flee its question.

Bearracuda
The fur-covered bearracuda fish live on the snowy slopes of
Mount Arbora and are synonymous with the dangers of traveling at the heights of the mountain. Though the practice is
uncommon now, there was a time when large bands of fisherman and trackers would hunt the predator for its meat and
furs, but due to the practice’s high casualty rate and the rise
in popularity of potion crafting, it became easier and more
lucrative for islanders to go after smaller fish.

Pacifying Light. If the Bearracuda becomes Blinded
by a light-based effect, it must also succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or fall Unconscious for 1
minute, until it takes damage, or until a creature uses
an action to shake or slap it awake.

Actions

Light on Its Feet. When the Cat of Prodigious Size
falls and isn’t Incapacitated, it can subtract up to 200
feet from the fall when calculating falling damage.

Cat Of Prodigious
Size
Cats are beloved creatures on Obojima—They are among
the most loyal of companions, skilled workers, and, in some
cases, even peers to other islanders. To most, a cat’s life is
considered too short, but that is not the case for all cats.
When a cat lives beyond its years, there is sometimes a
transformation that can occur. Rather than fading away, the
cat continues to flourish, growing stronger and larger, over
several years, until eventually, they gain a status: cat of
prodigious size.
This transformation is just
one of many that the cats of
Obojima can go through and is
regarded as one of the rarest.

272

Actions
Multiattack. The Cat of Prodigious Size makes two
attacks: one with its Chomp and one with its Paw.
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage, and if
the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is Grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target
is Restrained, and the Cat of Prodigious Size can’t bite
another target.
Paw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.
Leaping Strike. The Cat of Prodigious Size pulls its
body low to the ground before leaping vertically 90 feet
into the air. While in the air, the Cat of Prodigious Size
can make a Paw attack before slamming back down to
the ground. Each creature within 20 feet of the Cat of
Prodigious Size when it lands must succeed on a DC 17
Strength saving throw or be
knocked Prone.

Clone Of Viota
Clone Of Viota

Viota is a powerful spirit that takes the form of a little girl
made of black smoke. She has hundreds of bodies, all of
which look like this same unsettling and somehow disarming young lady. Each of her clones has a unique personality
and is living out its life somewhere on the island. Though
each of these clones has a different personality, some of
which are kind and caring, while others are dangerous and
cruel, they are all connected. What one clone experiences,
so do the others.

Innate Spellcasting. Clone of Viota’s innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit
with spell attacks). Clone of Viota can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:
◊ At will: Prestidigitation*, Retrieve, Task
◊ 1/day each: Invisibility*, Misty Step*
Lessons Learned. If any Clone of Viota has fought a
creature before, the current Clone of Viota can choose
at the start of combat to either have advantage on all
attack rolls made against that creature or advantage on
saving throws against effects created by that creature.
Shared Experience. Any Clone of Viota can spend 1
minute to perfectly recall an experience that one of
her other clones had. This is true even if that clone
has been killed.

Member of Society
Viota goes by many names and holds hundreds of professions. She lives on every corner of the island and dines
with all types of people, very few of which, truly understand what Viota is. In one town, she might be a young
witch apprentice studying to join a coven alongside dozens
of other students. In another settlement, she might be the
guard captain or owner of the local inn. At all times, she is
loved, hated, admired, and feared by those around her.

Danger to Society
Not every one of Viota’s clones are kind individuals—Some
are quite the opposite. They can be as cruel and manipulative as a demon or as dangerous and wild as a feral beast.
Some of these clones have found ways to live within the
confines of society, while others are cast out to the areas of
the island that few people wish to travel to. It’s these clones
that most wish to avoid at all costs.

Mystery of her Magic
At some point in the last few
decades, an unknown witch
was able to tap into Viota’s magic
and summon one of her clones
through the use of the Shadow
Child potion. To this day Viota is
unsure how this happened and
does whatever she can to stop
the use of that potion.

Actions
Multiattack. The Clone of Viota makes two Spectral
Pass attacks.
Spectral Pass. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d8 + 3) force damage.

When picking the Skills for
the Clone of Viota, be aware
that this may also affect other
traits of this creature.

Corrupted Muk
Corrupted muk are shallow mockeries of humanoid form
that emerge from pools of Corruption to wander about.
Apparently mindless, corrupted muk don’t seem to have any
agency, but they can suddenly act as a single entity if alerted.

Muk-Filled Mystery
Only a week after the tsunami brought the Corruption onto
the eastern side of the island it began to move and gradually coalesce into more and more human-like forms that
then huddled together or shambled about in a seemingly
mindless manner. Some who have encountered corrupted
muk have speculated that the Corruption may have some
intelligence, trying to mimic life. Some temple sages have
said that each corrupted muk is an Obojiman who was
taken in the disaster and that each muk slain is a spirit
released back to the island.

Crawler
These demons inhabit swamps and forests, masquerading as
mossy outcroppings or thick foliage as they wait in ambush
for unsuspecting prey. It transfixes its prey with its hypnotizing eye before enveloping and draining its victim of its
inner self and its memories. Although a crawler doesn’t kill
its victim itself, it condemns them to the dangerous Brackwater Wetlands without understanding the world around
them, which usually means easy pickings for one of the
swamp’s other dangerous predators.
Why these demons take the memories of poor travelers
isn’t known, but it is understood that these creatures revel
in the consumption of them.

Cuddle Bug
There are areas within the wilderness where cuddle bugs live within the earth, cold and dormant, until something stands or
sleeps on the ground above them. When that happens, cuddle bugs swiftly cluster to feed on the warmth, leaving their victim
exhausted or fatally drained of life. Generally, a campfire is enough to draw a cuddle bug out, but once it goes out, any remaining cuddle bugs will seek out other sources of heat.

“There’s nothing cuddly about those
blasted, frozen pests.”
—Postmaster Miranda Escalante

Cuddle Bug

Cuddle Bugs have no intention of killing their
victims, often times the bugs will leave after
they have sufficiently drained a creature. That

Deep Angler
This enormous, predatory fish has the uncanny ability to
cast an illusion around its lure to fit what its prey most
responds to. A curious adventurer might see a floating chest
of treasure, a swimmer in distress, or an empty boat floating
on the surface—whatever gets its prey to come a bit closer for
a better look. The deep angler has even been known to lunge
onto the shore to swallow its prey, and then wriggle back into
the water, making anything on the shoreline fair game.

Illusionary Lure. The Deep Angler can create an
image of an object, effect, or creature, which surrounds
its lure, causing the chosen effect to look as if it were
floating in space. The image can’t create sound or
smell, and physical interaction with the image reveals
it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it.

Actions
Multiattack. The Deep Angler makes two attacks: one
with its Chomp and one with its Lure.
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the
target is swallowed if it is a Large or smaller creature.
A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, has
total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
Deep Angler, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage
at the start of each of the Deep Angler’s turns.
The Deep Angler can hold up to 3 creatures in its mouth
at a time. If the Deep Angler takes 15 damage or more
on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Deep
Angler must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving
throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, each of which enters an empty space within
10 feet of the Deep Angler. If the Deep Angler dies, a
swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can
escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement.
Lure. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution
saving throw or be Blinded until the end of its next turn.

Tormented

Path to Exile

For the most part, demons cause varying forms of disturbance and mayhem as their unsettled nature cannot abide
beauty, silence, or stillness. Many believe that demons can
be released from the curse of their nature and returned
to their spirit form by resolving their turmoil and healing
their past, but that is a belief held by few who that have
come to meet a demon in their lifetime.

There are many strange and contorted paths to becoming
a demon, but the tale as old as Obojima, is that of the spirit
who stepped beyond a line set in stone by natural order.
When this creature becomes truly cruel, filled with malice,
and devoid of love and its body becomes too weak to hold
the wickedness festering inside itself — it starts its transformation.
Rumors say that under certain circumstances, even physical beings can become demons, but it takes a long time for
their obsessions and perceptions to warp them beyond their
humanity and into demonic form.

Dragon
The dragons on Obojima come in all sizes, shapes, and
demeanors. Some are playful, some are lazy, some are sagacious, and some are downright dumb. There are dragons
that live high in the mountains or deep underground, and
there are dragons that roam around and might take up residence in a farmer’s barn or curl up under a bridge. Dragons
can be animalistic and they can also be intellectual, so it’s
always good to know what kind of dragon you’re encountering before you attempt to commune with one.

Honored Guests
Most Obojimans believe that dragons are guardians of the
island, and there are many legends that tell of dragons
bringing good luck, good fortune, and other supernatural
boons to people and to the land. A dragon that takes up
residence on a farm is afforded all the hospitality from a
good scale scrubbing to home-cooked meals, and a dragon
that lives within a hill overlooking a town is certain to
have a shrine dedicated to it heaped with flowers, food, and
other offerings.

Ancient Elders
Across Obojima, temples and shrines to dragons are one
way to encounter these massive and sometimes magical
beasts but it’s wise to remember that not all dragons are
benevolent. Some dragons guard treasure or secrets and
others may even find humans somewhat delicious. Some
dragons have been on Obojima for a very long time and
their memories can stretch back a thousand years or more.
In that time, a dragon has seen generations come and go,
making human needs and lives seem as insignificant as a
leaf falling on an autumn evening.

Dragon Frog
Dragon Frogs are formidable monsters that once roamed the
island as towering behemoths whose steps left villages in
shambles—in today’s age, they are the domesticated workhorse of the Nakudama people. For centuries the dragon
frog has been shaped by Nakudama culture and desires,
which in return have changed the creature irrevocably. In
the Nakudama Age, it was common for dragon frogs to grow
to heights of 60 to 100 feet tall; now the average dragon frog
is no larger than a donkey.

tongue at a Medium or smaller creature or object it
can see within 25 feet of it. If the target is a creature,
it is pulled to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
Dragon Frog, unless it succeeds on a DC 12 Strength
saving throw. If the target is an object, it falls to
the ground at the Dragon Frog’s feet; if the object is
being worn or carried by a creature, the creature must
succeed on a contested Strength check or have the
object pulled away from it.

Legendary Actions
Quick Attack. Immediately after the
Dragon Frog pulls a creature with its
Pulling Tongue, it makes a Chomp attack
against it.

Near Extinction
During the Age of Nakudama, it became common for great
warriors to hunt Dragon Frogs. In certain stories, this was
also said to be a method by which one could gain knighthood from the queen. Although most records on this are
lost, there is a document that has over a hundred written
accounts of slain dragon frogs.
Historians believe it was also during this time when the
monarchy began to tame them.

Elder Dragon Frog
Most Nakudama would say that elder dragon frogs haven’t
existed in centuries. However, it doesn’t stop the myth
and rumor that some are still alive on the island today—
hiding from the mighty forces of the long-since dissolved
Nakudama armies. Little to no proof has been offered as
to where these creatures are hiding, but some academics
believe that there is some legitimacy to these claims.

Standing Leap. The Dragon Frog’s long jump is up
to 90 feet and its high jump is up to 45 feet, with or
without a running start.

Actions
Multiattack. The Dragon Frog makes three attacks:
one with its Chomp and two with its Claws.
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage, and the
target is swallowed if it is a Large or smaller creature.
A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, has
total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
Dragon Frog, and takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage
at the start of each of the Dragon Frog’s turns.

The Dragon Frog can hold up to three creatures in its
mouth at a time. If the Dragon Frog takes 20 damage
or more on a single turn from a creature inside it,
the Dragon Frog must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which enters an
empty space within 10 feet of the Dragon Frog. If the
Dragon Frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer
Restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using
10 feet of movement.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 13 (1d10 + 8) slashing damage.
Croak (Recharge 5–6). The Dragon Frog lets out a
ground-shaking croak that warps the environment in
a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a
DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target
takes 66 (12d10) thunder damage and is pushed 15 feet
away from the Dragon Frog. On a successful save, the
target takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
If the Dragon Frog has any creatures in its mouth when
it uses its Croak, they all fall Prone in unoccupied
spaces within 15 feet of the Dragon Frog.

Legendary Actions
The Dragon Frog can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature’s turn. The Dragon Frog regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Claw. The Dragon Frog makes a Claw attack.
Leap. The Dragon Frog leaps into the air before slamming back down to the ground. Each creature within
30 feet of the Dragon Frog when it lands must succeed
on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked Prone.
Pulling Tongue (Costs 2 Actions). The Dragon Frog
lashes out its tongue at a Huge or smaller creature or
object it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target is a
creature, it is pulled to an unoccupied space within
5 feet of the Dragon Frog, unless it succeeds on a DC
22 Strength saving throw; the Dragon Frog can then
make a Chomp attack against it as part of this same
action. If the target is an object, it enters the Dragon
Frog’s mouth; if the object is being worn or carried by
a creature, the creature must succeed on a contested
Strength check or have the object pulled away from it.

Dustbunny
Dustbunnies are relatively harmless, often pesky critters
that live within towns and out on the plains and grasslands
in deep burrows. There are many stories about dustbunnies,
the most common one being a cautionary tale to keep your
house or shop swept clean as it can quickly become overrun
by dustbunnies. Some believe they were created by Obojima
and are therefore good luck, so they allow the critters to
multiply in droves, but many just think it an excuse to get
out of housework. Whatever the case, most towns have
their fair share of dustbunnies and live in relative
harmony with them.

Dust Kick. The Dust Bunny kicks up dust at a creature

Field Giant
Field Giants are large and docile nature spirits known for
crafting the winds that roll across the western foothills of
the island. They’re enthralled with how the gentle breezes
interact with the world around them—Which is why
they’re often spotted gazing off in the distance. Because of
this, locals have made a habit of placing pinwheels out on
clotheslines to encourage the wind-making spirit to dry
their garments.

Not Predator, Not Prey
These giant spirits have grown to become one with the
environment, yet they seem to take nothing from it. Unlike
most creatures on Obojima, they need not sleep, or eat.

Fish folk are fish-like humanoid creatures who live under
the Shallows in grottoes and caves. They are generally
unpleasant and enjoy marauding along the coastline in their
makeshift boats. To many Obojiman’s they are considered
the Howlers of the sea. While the overall number of fish
folk is small, they are pesky, persistent, and opportunists.
When they raid villages, they usually do so with a dozen or
fewer bandits, and often when the villagers expect it least.

Fish Folk in General
Most fish folk live in the Shallows and are divided into two
kingdoms, those under the rule of the Lionfish King and
deepsea fishfolk under the rule of Venomous Rex. Almost
all deepsea fish folk are tainted by the Corruption and
afflicted by its horrific, skeletonizing effects making them
desperate and oftentimes unwell.

Villains and Cutthroats
Both kingdoms of fish folk are pirates and bullies, demanding tribute from all who roam their waters. These threats
are often hollow, but will do the trick, as most islanders
would rather pay to end a fish folk interaction than to save
a few gold.

Lionfish King
The Lionfish King is proud, temperamental, and dangerous,
yet not wholly beyond the reach of reason. His bristling
mane of spines often betrays his mood—whether fair or
foul. The Lionfish King’s whims are like the weather and
his cares range from himself, to the Corruption, to finding
a royal bride, and back to himself again. For more on the
Lionfish King, see “Domain of the Lionfish King” in the
Locations chapter.

“Pfff! All this talk of the
Nakudama and their web footed
wizardry! All I need is a ship, a
crew, and a sword to forge the
greatest kingdom in history!”

Giant Jellyfish
Of the many sea creatures that now call the sky their home,
the giant jellyfish are regarded as some of the most beautiful. Travelers who have seen the migrations of the giant
jellyfish time and time again are still awestruck when they
arrive each year. The gentle giants are content to float gracefully on the wind, undisturbed by others, and a vision of
tranquility to the world below—This is why artists over the
years have used them as the source of inspiration for many
iconic works of art on the island.

Festivals
The most famous migration of giant jellyfish is also one
of the largest festivals on Obojima—the Great Jellyfish
Migration Festival that is held every year in Sky Kite Valley.
At the end of summer, without fail, a vast school of giant
jellies floats east to west across the Land of Hot Water,
eventually hitting the peak of the great mountain. It’s here
where they complete their journey by rolling down the
slopes of Mount Arbora, along the coastline of Sky Kite
Valley, and out to sea. People from all over come to see this
amazing event of spectacular beauty.

Giant Koi
Giant Koi are enormous carp that languidly float through the sky. They don’t appear to
bother much with the land below other than to dip down to eat some grasses or shrubs
from a hillside or mountaintop but most seem to never need food. The giant koi come in
many different colors and patterns, and some have become famous over the centuries.
There are some old books that describe giant koi that are floating through the skies today
and it is unknown how long they live as they have no natural predators—at least until the
arrival of the Hunter.

Bringers of Good Fortune
Giant koi are revered and considered heralds of good fortune by most of Obojima’s
inhabitants. Even though giant koi roam the skies freely, they tend to stay around a
certain place, becoming mascots of towns and villages that hold festivals in their honor,
and it’s common to see children (and adults) wearing giant koi fish hats and flying kites
that look like their local giant koi.

Valuable Scales
Although it is greatly frowned on, treasure hunters and witches go to areas where giant
koi have been in hopes of finding a scale that has been shed from these magnificent
creatures. There has only been one recorded giant koi that has fallen to earth as the
result of predation by the Hunter. This resulted in the largest cache of giant koi
scales ever taken which were then used to build a shrine dedicated to the great fish.
Most other scales usually wind up in temples or shrines for all to see.

Goro Goro
The Goro Goro, also known as the Sake Demon, is a dangerous and feared monster that stalks small settlements and
towns—being one of the few creatures on the island that
only eats humanoids. Its hatred for meats unflavored by the
sweetness of alcohol has earned it its reputation for hunting
drunkards leaving bars or parties.

Stories
Before encountering a goro goro, people say they’ve seen
a bottle of booze presented beautifully on a small table in
the woods or even the raucous noise of a party calling their
name just off the beaten path. Others, too drunk to comprehend the dangers, have walked straight to the sweet smell
of the Goro Goro’s giant sake cup, never to be seen again.

Drunken Aura. Any creature hostile to the Goro Goro
that starts its turn within 20 feet of the Goro Goro
must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, unless
the Goro Goro is Incapacitated. On a failed save, the
creature is inebriated by potent fermented magic until
the start of its next turn. While inebriated in this way,
a creature takes a −4 penalty to all ability checks and
attack rolls.

reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d12 + 3) bludgeoning
damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, the creature is trapped under the Goro
Goro’s giant sake cup. A trapped creature is Blinded
and Restrained, has total cover against attacks and
other effects outside the giant sake cup, and suffers
one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns.
A trapped creature or an ally within 5 feet of the giant
sake cup can try to lift it with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check, ending its effects on a success. The effect
also ends early if the Goro Goro makes another Giant
Sake Cup attack or otherwise lifts the cup.

Hammer Gull
Hammer gulls are enormous gulls that are known for dropping large rocks on their prey—usually giant crabs and mollusks—to
crack their shells and get at the flesh. But hammer gulls are not the brightest of birds and have been known to simply drop
boulders on all manner of things including houses, boats, and beachgoers. Thus, hammer gulls are considered dangerous pests
by Obojimans and are chased away if they get too close for comfort.
There are some who have found ways to domesticate hammer gulls and use them as mounts by hatching one of their eggs
and raising them by hand. These “gull-tamers” are known throughout Obojima as being a cast of odd characters, cut from a
different cloth, and usually as loony as the gulls themselves.

Harpy
The origin of harpies is shrouded in mystery. Some say
they are cursed humans, a long-lost coven of witches who
dabbled with forbidden magic. Others say that the harpies
came to Obojima from beyond the horizon and are from
a different world entirely. Whatever the truth is, what is
certain is that harpies are generally raucous, aggressive, and
uncouth. They are prone to acts of bullying, piracy, and they
enjoy larceny in all its forms. They are often found in gangs
of three or more, and rare is the harpy who speaks with a
civil tongue and does not at some point resort to vulgarity
or name-calling when dealing with others.
Harpies see people as rubes (at best) and as food (at
worst). Harpies enjoy tormenting the innocent, and the
more sheltered and naive the person is, the more the
harpies enjoy shocking them with their lack of couth and
civility. The thing a harpy hates most is ambivalence, so the
bigger the reaction, the more inwardly pleased a harpy is.
Islanders think of the harpies as wretched souls who are
best left alone to their own wickedness. They are considered
cursed and magical creatures, so some witches are curious
to know if things like a harpy’s spit, a talon, a lock of hair,
or a feather would have some magical properties for brewing potions, but to this day, no one has been willing to take
the risk to find out.

there’s a clarity to their communication
that can’t be misinterpreted.”

Hill Dragon
Hill dragons are notoriously aggressive and territorial—
Which paired with their long hunting treks throughout the
Gale Fields, has earned them a “flee on sight” command by
the Courier brigade. They often accumulate a layer of sod,
dirt, and debris on their backs, which bonds with their claylike bodies. This hallmark grassy coat of the hill dragon is
not just an outcome of their life sleeping in the fields but
also perfect ambush camouflage when hunting the fast and
elusive Sheep Dragon.

Eggs
Looking like pumpkin-sized acorns, hill dragon eggs can
remain dormant in the ground for a year or more before
they hatch. Hill dragon eggs are usually buried out of sight,
but certain flowers like to grow around burial pits giving
their positions away, and egg-hunting hogs can be trained
to sniff them out.
Not known for powerful maternal instincts, hill
dragons lay their eggs in clutches all across the
plains, dales, and rolling hills of Obojima.

Howlers

Howler Yipper

Howlers are monsters, and if there’s one thing in all of
Obojima that gives villagers the most grief and worry, it’s
howlers. They’re responsible for more raids on farmhouses,
stolen livestock, and pillaged wagons than any other creature on Obojima.

Howler Yippers are the bottom of the pecking order in a
howler pack making them both craven and surly. Yippers
spend their limited brain power bullying, stealing, and
generally messing around. Most yippers work hard to curry
favor with their superiors by bringing offerings and heaps
of flattery, but it is in their nature to do acts of mischief and
destruction, so they inevitably incur wrath and punishment
from their elders.

Howlers are fairly large, hyena-like humanoids that live
in endlessly squabbling packs led by the most crafty or the
most combative among them. Most of the howler population live in burrows and dens throughout the Gale Fields,
but there are small gangs that live in the wildernesses all
across Obojima.

Howler Worldview
Howlers generally see the rest of the world as resources to
be taken or a toy to be played with. They have little empathy, which is why they don’t see an issue with taking something they want, even if that means robbing and stealing
to get it. Their main desires are food, territory, and trophies
to impress their pack and their leader, known as “snarlers”.
Howlers sleep when their snarler does, and even then it’s
only for a few hours a day, so they are almost always active
in seeking whatever will get them more favor and status
within the group.
A howler clan can be a mix of scheming, toadying,
raucous, and indifferent, with brief bursts of showboating
from their snarler to establish dominance.

Rogue Howler
Not every howler belongs to a pack, and these “rogue” howlers are among the most aggressive and dangerous and are
often the ones that cause concern among villages.

Public Enemy
Most Obojimans know of howlers and it is one of the
reasons why villagers take at least some instruction from
the sword schools or resident fighters so that they can
defend their crops, livestock, and merchandise. Despite the
warnings, there are always those who believe howlers are
misunderstood and just need a hug, but more often than
not, they come back from their missions of mercy missing
teeth or not at all.

296

Howler Snarlers
Howler Snarlers are often the leaders of howler packs due to
their great strength and keen intellect but they are also the
ones most susceptible to flattery and greed. A snarler’s day
is spent showing the clan just how much of a snarler they
are—bossing other howlers around, making big barking
sounds, and leading raids to get food and loot.
A snarler’s life is usually short, often ending in betrayal at
the hands of the next snarler or failure of a grandiose stunt.

Howler Stalkers
Although howlers are pack monsters, some howlers shy
away from the clan, preferring to lurk in the scrublands
or in the darkness where they can move unseen and more
easily ambush prey. These howler stalkers are the ones that
you don’t hear barking a mile away and that you don’t see
coming. While the pack as a whole can take down large
game once every several outings, the stalkers may not take
down a massive beast, but they never return empty-handed.
Snarlers and stalkers have a tenuous relationship within
howler clans, and it’s often a threat for snarlers to have
more than a handful of stalkers in a pack as snarlers always
like to know where their enemies are coming from.

The Hunter
The Hunter is the second of the “Three Great Beasts” of Obojima—a title given to the creatures that are said to be chosen by
the island as its protectors. The Hunter is the largest among the three: a towering stork that swallows whole the Giant Koi that
float through the sky and creates violent crashing waves when it glides across the ocean surface. It is the embodiment of natural beauty and is regarded by the islanders as a symbol of Obojima’s will.

Historic Past
The Hunter has been roaming Obojima for centuries. Historic records claim that the Hunter first appeared during the Age of
Nakudama, where it fought a colossal sea snake that had wrapped itself around the top of Mount Arbora. This is just one of
the great beast’s many feats, as tales throughout history speak of the Hunter’s triumphs.

Truth or Legend?
The Hunter, like all of the great beasts, is an animal, and it obeys its natural desires and needs. However, most islanders
assign the Hunter goals which they think it has come to the island to achieve. The most common of these ideas is that the
Hunter was summoned by the island to protect its people from whatever is beyond the Shallows.

Legendary Resistance (5/Day). If the Hunter fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Limited Magic Immunity. Unless it wishes to be
affected, the Hunter is immune to spells of 6th level
or lower. It has advantage on saving throws against all
other spells and magical effects.
Magic Weapons. The Hunter’s weapon attacks
are magical.
New Life. When the Hunter dies, a new great beast is
born into the world.
Spirit of Obojima (1/Day). If the Hunter drops below
250 hit points, it automatically regains 100 hit points.

Actions
Multiattack. The Hunter makes three attacks: two
with its Claw and one with Peck.
Claw. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) slashing damage.
Peck. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) piercing damage.
Inspiring Presence. Each creature of the Hunter’s
choice that is within 1,000 feet of the Hunter and aware
of it gains inspiration and 19 (3d12) temporary hit points.
Once a creature benefits from the Hunter’s Inspiring
Presence, it can’t do so again until 7 days have passed.

Peck. The Hunter makes a Peck attack.
Spiral Flight (Costs 2 Actions). The Hunter briefly
pulls its wings in while twisting its body. Each creature on top of the Hunter must succeed on a DC 22
Strength (Athletics) check or be thrown in a random
direction 30 feet away from the Hunter. In addition,
creatures flying within 30 feet of the Hunter are
pushed 15 feet away from it.
Swallow (Costs 2 Actions). The Hunter attempts to
engulf a creature it can see within 20 feet of it. The
target creature must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity
saving throw or be swallowed by the Hunter. A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, it has total
cover against attacks and other effects outside the
Hunter, and it takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage at
the start of each of the Hunter’s turns.
If the Hunter takes 30 damage or more on a single turn
from a creature inside it, the Hunter must succeed on a
DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn
or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone
in a space within 10 feet of the Hunter.
If the Hunter dies, a swallowed creature is no longer
Restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using
20 feet of movement, exiting Prone.
Thunderous Beak (Costs 3 Actions). The Hunter
hisses and clacks its enormous beak, which creates
a deafening sound that can be heard for miles. Each
creature, other than the Hunter, within 150 feet of the
Hunter must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw;
a swallowed creature automatically fails this save. On a
failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) thunder damage
and becomes Deafened for 24 hours or until it is target
by a Lesser Restoration* spell. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t Deafened.

◊ 1/day: Butterfly Storm

Kafuka
Kafuka are small and meek bird-like humanoids that live all
across the island—The polar opposite to the rowdy harpies.
They claim a small copse of trees, which they call their
domain, and it is here that they rule over the tiny woodland
creatures that happen to wander through. Though the Kafuka
often keep to themselves, if a creature were to disturb their
domain, they’re known to be quite cruel and unrelenting—
Going as far as branding children as punishment.

The First of its Kind
The first of the Kafuka were said to once be children, who,
at some point, were cursed by the island as punishment for
their misdeeds. These stories still propagate on the island,
but it’s more common for people to believe them to be one
of the many odd creatures that inhabit the woods.

302

Mimicry. The Kafuka can mimic animal sounds and
humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds
can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 13
Wisdom (Insight) check.
Speak with Beasts. Kafuka can comprehend and
verbally communicate with Beasts as if they shared
a language.

Actions
Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

Summon Swarm (2/Day). If available, the Kafuka
causes a group of tiny woodland animals to form a
swarm and attack a creature that the Kafuka can see.
This swarm of woodland creatures uses the Swarm of
Rats* stat block and immediately disperses when it
takes damage

Lion’s Blume

Lion’s Blume
Lion’s blume is a most peculiar and troublesome plant, feared by beekeepers yet
sought after by brewers. Its golden-hued
petals are charming to the eye, but at
the very heart of this plant lies a gaping
maw, ready to snap shut upon any unfortunate bee (or beekeeper) that strays too
near. Beekeepers often speak ill of the lion’s
blume, calling it a weed, for it decimates
their hives with alarming efficiency.

Pride and Prejudice
The flower grows in clusters, known as “prides,” scattered
across the windy moors of the Coastal Highlands. Each
pride has its own family, or lineage, and it is quite common
to find them in silent battle, their roots entwined in a fierce
competition, each trying to choke the life from neighboring
prides. Because of this natural competition, being kind to
one lion’s blume plant may incur the jealous wrath from its
nearby neighbors.

Dangerous but Useful
Despite its ill reputation, brewers hold the lion’s blume in
high regard. Its milky sap is prized for concocting rare and
curious beverages, while the sharp, tooth-like structures
within the flower are often harvested for other uses. Thus,
though many may curse its presence, there are those who
wander the moors in search of the elusive lion’s blume,
ever mindful of its significant bite.

303

Mosslings
Mosslings are shy woodland spirits that are easily mistaken
for clumps of vegetation or small, moss-covered stones.
Because they are inquisitive, mosslings will follow a band
of travelers while doing their best to remain camouflaged.
If befriended, mosslings have also been known to show
adventurers hidden areas of the forest that are sacred or
magical as well as give them trinkets from the forest to
mark their friendship. Mosslings are almost always found
in groups but each has their own quirky personality.

Pixies are mischievous spirits that enjoy interacting with
the Material Realm. Pixies feed off of emotions, so it is
generally the case that the more frustrated or reactionary one gets with them, the more they respond by being
naughty and insolent. The more stoic and implacable one is,
the more relaxed and agreeable the pixies are.
They’re considered the definition of a pest spirit, which
is why most Obojimans tolerate pixies at best and despise
them at worst.

Perfume Poof. The mossling can cast
Pacify Person at will, and its spell save DC is 11.

Actions
Gift of Flight. The Pixie magically grants a creature it
can see a Flying speed of 30 feet. The creature keeps its
Flying speed, as long as the Pixie is holding its breath.
The Pixie can hold its breath for a number of minutes
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30
seconds). The Pixie can only grant this effect to one
creature at a time, and when the effect ends, it must
wait 1 minute before using it again.

Postal Knight
A postal knight is an elite member of the Courier Brigade,
an order of knights dedicated to the protection and delivery
of parcels. Operating in small squads, they brave treacherous roads, bandit ambushes, and magical hazards to ensure
that vital packages reach their destinations.
Sworn in through a ceremonial oath, these warriors
embrace the motto, “Deliverance through delivery” and the
rigorous training it takes to become a knight reflects their
dedication to their sacred task.
The ranks of the Courier Brigade are led by the Postmaster General, a figure of great respect, who oversees operations from the guild’s headquarters in Yatamon. Most of
their ceremonies take place in the First Age city and at Fort
Harglo in the Gale Fields.
Obojimans as a whole respect and support postal knights
and it is well known that every postal knight has a home
anywhere on the island—all they have to do is knock and
food and shelter shall be theirs.
Though their purpose
may seem humble, postal
knights take great pride in
their service, embodying the
true spirit of guardianship.
For them, every delivery
makes a difference.

or effect that would alter its form.
Magic Resistance. The golem has advantage

magical effects.
Magic Weapons. The golem’s weapon
attacks are magical.

Rubble
Golem
These strange creatures are
said to be the embodiment
of wayward travelers who
passed away during a building
collapse. In their current form,
they’re incredibly territorial
and don’t often stray far from
their den. Some believe they’re
bound to the land where their lives
were taken, others seem to think
they’re guarding the remains of their
previous body.

306

Multiattack. The golem makes two slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
Collapse (Recharge 5–6). The golem targets a
15-foot-diameter circle within 15 feet of itself. Each
creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or be crushed as the golem leaps and lands in
the designated location, turning into a shockwave
of rubble and transforming into its rubble form. On
a failed save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) bludgeoning
damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked
prone.
While the golem is in rubble form, the area of impact is
considered difficult terrain, the golem is incapacitated
and has resistance to all damage, and it automatically
fails Dexterity saving throws.
The golem returns to its original form at the start of its
next turn, shunting any creature in its space to another
unoccupied space within 5 feet of it.

Seaweed Elemental
Terrifying tales of seaweed elementals are told in many of
the taverns along the Obojiman coastline—sailors wrapped
in swaths of green kelp and being dragged to the bottom
of the Shallows are a common thread in stories that send
chills down the spine. For the most part, the Shallows are
clear of kelp, so spotting a seaweed elemental is easy for a
vigilant sailor, but for those who wish to explore the underwater realm, a seaweed elemental is a serious threat, especially if one wanders into its domain.

Entangling Form. A creature that touches the
Seaweed Elemental or hits it with a melee attack while
within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength
saving throw or become Restrained by the elemental.
At the start of each of the Restrained creature’s turns,
it takes 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage as the tendrils of
seaweed squeeze it. The Restrained creature can spend
its action to attempt the saving throw again, ending
the effect on a success. If the elemental moves more
than 10 feet away from the Restrained creature, the
effect ends.
False Appearance. If the Seaweed Elemental is
motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage
on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn’t
observed the Seaweed Elemental move or act, that
creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the Seaweed Elemental
isn’t ordinary seaweed.
Mostly Clumps. The Seaweed Elemental can move
through a space as narrow as 5 inches wide without
squeezing.

Actions

Multiattack. The elemental makes two Slam attacks.
Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3
(1d6) poison damage.

307

Sheep Dragon
These playful creatures are known to live among the rolling
hills alongside livestock and other grazing beasts. Although
their name and serpent-like body might confuse some, the
sheep dragon is not a dragon, but rather more akin to a
dog. These odd creatures aren’t known to be violent but do
have a variety of tools to protect themselves when they feel
they’re in danger.

Iconic Symbol
The sheep dragon is often regarded as the epitome of goodness and authenticity on the island. Their seen as a symbol
of freedom and unwavering kinship, which is why their
likeness can be found all throughout villages and towns as a
way to let travellers know they’re welcome.

Rush. If the sheep dragon moves at least 20 feet in a
straight line, during which it moves within 5 feet of a
creature and flies past it, that creature must make a DC
14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pulled 10 feet in the direction the sheep dragon
is moving and knocked prone, and the sheep dragon
doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack from it. On a
successful save, the creature isn’t pulled or knocked
prone, and if it makes an opportunity attack against
the sheep dragon, it does so with disadvantage.

Actions
Multiattack. The sheep dragon makes two attacks:
one with its bite and one with its headbutt. Alternatively, it makes three wind pistol attacks.
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

Shrapnel. If a creature within 5 feet of the swarm hits
it with a melee attack while the swarm isn’t underwater, the creature must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw as bits of tiny bones pelt it. On a failed save, the
creature flinches, giving it disadvantage on the next
attack roll it makes this turn.
Skeletonized. The swarm doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.
Swarm. The swarm can occupy another creature’s
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through
any opening large enough for a Tiny fish. The swarm
can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

Actions
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 0

swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

Skeletal Fish
Skeletal Fish are a result of the Corruption that has infected
the waters off the eastern shore of Obojima. Whether it is
some strange property of the Corruption or whether it is
Obojima’s magic keeping them alive, the fish still swim—
Both in water and in the air.

Sky King

Historic Past

The Sky King is the first and the oldest of the “Three Great
Beasts” of Obojima—and perhaps the oldest being on the
island. Its age is so great that its body, which was once a
majestic glistening shark with a blue hue that was said to
make the skies look dull, is now rendered to cartilage and
bone. Still, the great beast continues to soar through the
clouds and dive below the waves—the island’s magic keeping the king’s body intact.

It’s said that the Sky King was once the great protector of
Obojima—in an age when the Hunter was just a hatchling and the island was at war. The Sky King was a vigilant
guardian who helped the Nakudama people and saw the end
of a demonic rule over the island. Since that time, the Sky
King has become more recluse. Its once watchful gaze over
the island has subsided, aiding in the rise of the Hunter’s
role as the protector and adding to the mystery and intrigue
that now permeates around the Sky King.

Truth or Legend?
Many believe that the Sky King is being kept alive by the
Obojima for some reason. These rumors and stories have
spread all across the island for hundreds of years and
have been the catalyst for many famed adventurers and
explorers to uncover the truth behind the Sky King and its
mysterious past.

Cloud Trail. Wherever the Sky King flies, it creates a
trail of giant fluffy white clouds in its wake.
Legendary Resistance (5/Day). If the Sky King fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Limited Magic Immunity. Unless it wishes to be
affected, the Sky King is immune to spells of 6th level
or lower. It has advantage on saving throws against all
other spells and magical effects.
Magic Weapons. The Sky King’s weapon attacks are

New Life. When the Sky King dies, a new great beast
is born into the world.
Spirit of Obojima (1/Day). If the Sky King drops
below 150 hit points, a giant storm begins to brew
above and the oceans begin to become uneasy. For the
next minute, creatures that touch the Sky King or hit it
with a melee attack take 9 (2d10) lightning damage.

Multiattack. The Sky King makes three attacks: two
with its Chomp and one with its Tail.
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target. Hit: 17 (3d6 + 7) piercing damage.
Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
Inspiring Presence. Each creature of the Sky King’s
choice that is within 300 feet of the Sky King and
aware of it gains inspiration and a flying speed of 30
feet for the next minute. Once a creature benefits from
the Sky King’s Inspiring Presence, it can’t do so again
until 7 days have passed.

Legendary Actions
The Sky King can take 5 legendary actions, choosing
from the options below. Only one legendary action
option can be used at a time and only at the end of
another creature’s turn. The Sky King regains spent
legendary actions at the start of her turn.
Chomp. The Sky King makes a Chomp attack.
Turbulent Shift (Costs 2 Actions). The air or water
surrounding the Sky King begins to spin violently.
Each creature, other than the Sky King, within 60
feet of the Sky King must make a DC 20 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6)
bludgeoning and is disoriented until the end of its next
turn. A disoriented creature makes all ability checks
and saving throws with disadvantage. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t
disoriented. Objects and structures in the area automatically take maximum damage from this effect.
Nullify (Costs 3 Actions). The effects of all spells of
3rd level or lower within 120 feet of the Sky King are
suspended (as if by the Antimagic Field* spell) until
the start of the Sky King’s next turn, at which point
their magic returns.

Jumaga The Sky
Salamander
Jumaga is the third and youngest of the “Three Great
Beasts” of Obojima—Though its reputation is considerably
less prestigious than that of its counterparts. Most would
consider Jumaga to be the most reckless and unpredictable
of the islands chosen three, a sentiment supported by Jumaga’s actions. In the Age of Dara alone, Jumaga has caused
many disasters, from avalanches to tsunamis, and forest
fires alike—each incident painting Jumaga differently. At
one point, Jumaga was even seen entangled in a brawl with
the Hunter, a fight which lasted several days. Still, the Great
Beast has garnered the respect of the Islanders.
Unlike the Sky King or the Hunter, Jumaga calls a portion of
the island its domain. It is here that the locals have found a
symbiotic relationship with Jumaga, and in doing so, shown
a new side to the Great Beast.

The Last Century
In the last 100 years, Jumaga has seemingly satiated its
reckless and wild desires, its bestial actions now seen by
islanders as almost ceremonial. Its domain has also become
a sight in which islanders pay respect, leaving behind at the
ledge of offering valuables, which they hope will please the
great beast, and hide their cattle from Jumaga’s view.

Spew Magma (Recharge 5–6). Ranged Weapon Attack:
+7 to hit, range 30/90 ft., three targets. Hit: 18 (2d12 +
5) fire damage. Regardless of whether the attacks hit or
miss, the area within 5 feet of each target is covered
in lava. The lava is considered difficult terrain, and a
creature that starts its turn in the lava takes 6 (1d12)
fire damage. The lava cools and hardens after 1 minute,
at which point it becomes harmless and is no longer
difficult terrain.
Cough. The Slagger coughs a sulfurous cloud in a
30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make
a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 13 (2d12)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

Slagger
Slaggers are thought to be ancient elemental beings born
from the merging of magma and earth spirits deep in the
mines. Many miners believe they are the jealous guardians of Obojima’s riches, which is why miners must
tread carefully in their domain. While not inherently
malevolent, their moody and territorial nature makes
them unpredictable. Miners often leave offerings
of coal, hoping to avoid the destructive wrath
of the slagger. There’s more than one story of
an entire mine being abandoned due to the
stubbornness of one particularly irritable and
enormous slagger.

Slimes

Orange slimes are sticky and gelatinous and have a
signature acrid odor. They can be found near fumaroles and
bubbling sulfur springs. They range widely in size and there
are some Obojimans who make a business out of collecting
tiny bits of orange slime to put in firecrackers.

On Obojima, witches, warlocks, and wizards have long
studied the wonders of slimes. Their strange, natural properties have been an object of fascination for centuries, and
harnessing their powers has been an ongoing alchemical
pursuit that has left more than one would-be potion brewer
missing their eyebrows or a finger.

Corrupted Slime

Slimes are intelligent enough to know that they are
sought out for their properties, so most of them are furtive
and will scatter at the first sign of an ingredient hunter.
Each slime has adapted clever and explosive ways of
deterring and escaping from various forms of danger.

Corrupted slimes are strange and unpredictable, as not
much is known about how the Corruption affects the various slimes. But the most dangerous thing about them is
that they can potentially spread the Corruption to whomever they come in contact with.

Although most Obojimans don’t travel that far from their
villages, almost all have heard of slimes as every school kid
gets a lecture about the peculiarities and dangers of slimes.

Corrupted slimes are glutinous and will adhere to their
prey that becomes afflicted with a ghastly, growing weakness until it is removed or the slime is satiated.

Green Slime

Outside of the rare bottle of it in some witch’s grotto or
a wizard’s study, corrupted slime in the wild is only to be
found in or near the Corruption zone on the eastern side of
Obojima. Thus, it is virtually unknown to the island at large.

Green slimes live in wet and damp places, jungles, caverns,
and deep underground where the moistness soothes and
softens their prickly, acidic skin. Green slimes are notoriously terrified of everything. They’re capable of forming spike-like appendages which it uses to move with an
uncanny agility and they can also shed parts of its body as
distractions to predators and ingredient hunters while they
scurry away to safety.

Yellow Slime
Due to their stomach-churning stench, many yellow slime
stories are told with visible distress at even the
memory of the encounter. In its undisturbed
state, yellow slimes smell slightly vile, but
disturb it through careless footfalls or poke it with
a stick, and it spurts out jets of foulness that can
nauseate even the most iron-bellied of companions.
Many children who are in the Society of Young Stewards have their “yellow slime story” that they are more
than eager to tell.
Yellow slimes are partial to swamps and
forests where rotting wood and decaying
leaf-litter is readily available.

Orange Slime
Orange slime is perhaps the most dangerous of
all the known slimes and, although it is rare, it
can live almost anywhere on the island, turning
up in the most inopportune ways. Most orange
slimes explode before a witch can carefully collect it
or, if found near a village, a mage can be called to safely
dispose of it. In and around Mount Arbora, there have been
stories of orange slimes big enough to blow up a house or
blast a hole in a stone wall.

Snowball Spirits
Snowball spirits are small, fist-sized spirits that are curious
and playful. They can be found anywhere there is a thick
blanket of snow and are easy to locate due to their clinking, tinkling laughter. But if a group of snowball spirits feel
threatened they can swarm together to create a larger and
larger snowball made up of their tiny bodies. The more and
more grumpy a snowball spirit gets, the larger it grows,
until it becomes a terrifying behemoth as big as a house.
Even at this giant size, a snowball spirit is a surprisingly fast
adversary that can shoot out snowballs like a cannon and
can leap through the air to easily engulf a horse and rider.

target is at least one size smaller than the snowball
spirits, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving
throw or be whelmed by the snowball spirits. A
whelmed creature is considered grappled (escape DC
14) and is carried with the snowball spirits when they
move. A creature within 5 feet of the spirits can pull a
whelmed creature out of them by taking an action to
make a DC 14 Strength check, freeing the creature on
a success.
The snowball spirit can have no more than one creature whelmed at a time, unless it reaches the Huge
size, at which point it can whelm up to three creatures
at a time.
Snowball. Whenever the snowball spirits take the
Dash action, they can make a slam attack as part of
that action. Alternatively, if they are in snowy terrain,
they can choose to absorb the snow during the movement, growing by one size and regaining 10 hit points.

Soda Slime
Grape, Orange, Strawberry, and Cola, these ancient sodas
and more can be found across the island, kept pristine by
the magics of the First Age and Obojima. But when the
magic protecting these delicious treats begins to spoil, a
peculiar creature can start to form inside these colorful
metal cans. Soda slimes have been the lament of adventurers and mages alike who have taken it upon themselves to
explore the forgotten buildings left behind from the First
Age. Also known by the name Sugar Slimes, these tiny
oozes can be very territorial when they’re not hibernating
or searching for other slimes to consume.

real treat. It’s the best and easiest way to experience the Spirit Realm in all Obojima.”

Spirit

Elder Spirits

Spirits are beings that have their origins in the Spirit Realm
but they can be found living all across Obojima and they are
as much a part of Obojiman society as all the other beings
who live there whether human, elf, Nakudama, or dara.

Elder spirits are the most ancient beings of the Spirit Realm
and their power is such that their influence extends into
the realm of the material as well. If an elder spirit embodies
a river or inhabits a singular mountain or stretch of forest,
their presence can be seen in the morning stillness of a lake
and their voice can be heard in the rustling wind through
the trees.

From the Formless, Many Forms
Spirits by their nature are immaterial but when in the
Physical Realm, they take on material form to be as solid as
anyone else. Many spirits look one way when in the Physical realm and look wholly different when they return to
the Spirit Realm. When they take on a physical form, they
usually mimic or incorporate some shape or characteristics
of plants, animals, or minerals. A spirit may take on the
form of a radish or a cat or a stone, but they can be of any
size and coloration that the spirit chooses. Spirits seem to
choose their form and stay happy with it but there are cases
where a spirit may transform its shape or metamorphose
into another form, when this happens, it is usually a result
of some magical evolution, the removal of a curse, or the
movement from one realm to the other.

Sometimes an elder spirit takes the form of a great and
mythical beast like a sinuous dragon that twists through the
clouds or a mountainous toad that gazes at the moon and
weeps magic pearls.

Animalistic Spirits

The relationship of Obojimans to elder spirits is as intertwined as the bees to the flowers, for there is a give and
take where one helps the other. Elder spirits may need the
aid of heroes to restore life to the land and in turn they may
grant boons and magic to those who honor their quests.

Animalistic spirits are often far removed from society,
taking comfort and respite with the wild animals of the
island rather than the people. They can take many forms,
but they almost always look like some version of a beastial creature. These spirits, unlike normal spirits, are less
evolved and desire simpler lives. Because of this, they’re
seen by Obojimans (including other spirits) as lesser beings,
more akin to the animals they commune with.

Pest Spirits
Pest spirits are usually the least intelligent of the spirits and
are considered even by spirits as an unfortunate irritation
to tolerate. Pest spirits are usually obsessed with a singular thing—gobbling sugary treats, tying things in knots,
and your general compulsive thievery. They are normally
innocent creatures without malice aforethought, simply
compelled to do whatever it is that brings displeasure and
annoyance to the rest of the island.

Almost all elder spirits on Obojima are known—most are
known by many, but some may only be known by a few or a
single person. These people who know of the elder spirits tend to mark the borders of their domains by erecting
shrines or gateways that provide a reminder to all who pass
that they are entering hallowed ground.
For the most part, elder spirits are respected by
Obojimans who see them as protectors and providers, creatures of great power and mystery, and another wonderful
excuse for a festival with competitions and celebrations.

“They are the connection points
between the Spirit Realm and
Obojima, a place that is both spirit
and material. You can feel it in the
air, and see it in the earth. The trees
grow different here and the rocks take
on colors and patterns. Such is the
power of an elder spirit.”
—Adira, master healer

Stone Whale
Although the stone whales were not the first sea creatures
to take to the skies, they have done better than any at
adapting to life above the ocean. Their friendly demeanor
and natural affinity with surface flora have made a comfortable life on the island.

Island Culture
Stone Whales have become significant to many islanders
due to their migratory nature and the vegetation that grows
on their backs. To some, stone whales serve as a method
of travel. Wanders & Merchants are known to use the
great beasts for quick transport across the island.
Others like witches and farmers utilize the plants
that grow on the backs of the stone whales for
tonics, elixirs, and potions. These whales are
also known to carry vegetables and plants
that might normally only grow in one
section of the island, which is why many
would jump at the opportunity to explore
the back of a stone whale.

throw if the stul isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save,
the creature becomes charmed for 1 minute.
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The effect ends early for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an
action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

Ac tions
Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8)
poison damage.
Becon. The stul commands any number of creatures
charmed by its Hallucinatory Chatter to approach it.
Each creature must spend its action on its next turn to
move as close to the stul as it can.
Mental Invasion. One creature the stul chooses that
can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving
throw or be forced to use its reaction to move its
full speed in the opposite direction of the stul.

326

It’s said that the first stul was cursed into existence after
a young Nakudama mage abandoned his companion spirit
deep underground within the winding caves in Mount
Arbora. By the time the companion resurfaced, its hardship had permanently altered it, leaving it with no recollection of its previous life, except for an innate feeling to
call for its old friend.

“Stuls? Don’t go near them, dearie. They’re
filled with twisted magic that gets in your
guts. It imposes its past on your mind and
smothers you in its longing.”

Urugama
Urugama

The Urugama are malevolent creatures that roam the countryside at night. Their terrifying laugh and wicked masks
are so well known children’s rhymes are written about
them. These evil spirits have been said to attack travelers
after their fire has gone out so a common superstition held
by many merchants is to keep your fire burning all through
the night.

Severed Body. Urugama has four spectral bodies, each
of which urugama can take actions from. These different bodies can’t move more than 100 feet away from
each other, and Urugama divides its movement among
its four bodies as it chooses.
Shifting Form. At the start of Urugama’s turn, one of
its bodies is randomly selected as the true urugama.
Only the true body can take damage or suffer effects
that round. The other bodies can still be targeted with
attacks and effects, but they are unaffected and pass
through the bodies without harm.

Actions
Multiattack. Two of urugama’s forms
make a spectral pass attack.
Spectral Pass. Melee Weapon Attack: +8
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage.
Haunting Chuckle. If at least three
of urugama’s bodies are within 20
feet of each other, they can release a
haunting chuckle. All creatures within
30 feet of an urugama body that can
hear them must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. On
a failed save, the creature is immune to urugama’s
Haunting Chuckle for the next 24 hours.

Stoke the fire, don’t snuff the light; The
Urugama hunts at night.
Clutch your blade, hold tight your staff;
For when you hear it’s wicked laugh.
The winds will turn, the trees will bend,
and moments after, your life will end.

This spell has a save DC of 12, and it increases by 1 for
each vespoma within 30 feet of it (to a maximum of 20).

328

One of the most storied dangers of the Brackwater Wetlands
comes in the form of a creature known as a vespoma. This
canopy dweller resembles something between a bat and a
monkey, and where there is one, there are often a handful
of others. A vespoma is typically heard before it’s seen, a
fact that makes this creature so notorious, for the sound of
its voice is laced with magic that compels its prey. Multiple
vespoma harmonize, making their collective voice all the
more potent. Vespoma are not simply hunters. They have a
cruel nature and they are known to toy with their prey.
Many stories are told of the vespoma’s origin, but the
most common opinion is that some time ago, a witch who
lived in the Brackwater Wetlands taught these creatures
the rudiments of spellcraft, which they then passed on to
subsequent generations. Whatever the truth is, rangers
familiar with the wetlands are known to warn travelers to
avoid the voices in the trees.

Vile Corruption
Vile Corruption is the name given to one of the dangerous
manifestations of living sicknesses that plague the eastern side of the island—A shapeshifting aquatic thing that
terrorizes the Brackwater Wetlands, mimicking the creatures
that live within the woodland and striking without cause
or hesitation. Since its introduction to the environment,
factions such as the Toraf and Boulder’s sword school and
the Rangers of the Greenward Path have been adamant
about warning travelers to avoid the creature at all costs.
Both organizations share the opinion that it is best to not
get where you are going if it means keeping your life.

Flammable. The Vile Corruption is considered flammable and ignites as if it were a flammable object. If
the Vile Corruption takes more than 35 fire damage
from a single attack or effect, or if it is on fire for 3 or
more rounds, it explodes in a black ball of flames. Each
creature within 20 feet of the Vile Corruption when it
explodes must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 35 (10d6) fire damage of a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

Magic Resistance. The Vile Corruption has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects.
Shapechanger. The Vile Corruption can change its
shape to match that of any beast, demon, elemental,
monstrosity, or spirit at will. Its statistics, other than
its size, are the same in each form. While in this form
the Vile Corruption still keeps its watery appearance.

Actions
Multiattack. The Vile Corruption makes three attacks:
one with its bestial bite and two with its claw mimicry.
Bestial Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. The
target must then succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or have putrid water forced down its
throat. On a failed save, the water enters the creature’s
stomach and nullifies any potions currently affecting it.
Claw Mimicry. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.
Avian Mimicry. Waterlogged copies of songbirds
burst from the Vile Corruption and soar toward up to 3
creatures that are within 30 feet of it. Each target must
make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10)
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

Dispel Susceptibility. The Wandering Door becomes
a mundane pile of rubble if it’s targeted by a Dispel
Magic* spell of 7th level or higher.
Doorway. A creature that enters the Wandering Door
can teleport to any doorway on any plane as if the
doorway was planted directly in front of the location.
If a creature is not aware of how the door’s magic
works, it is instead teleported to a random doorway.
Immutable Form. The Wandering Door is immune to
any spell or effect that would alter its form.
Legendary Resistance (7/Day). If the Wandering Door
fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Like the Wind. The Wandering Door’s movement
doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Wandering Door
Only a handful of people on Obojima have seen the
enchanted moving doorway. Every now and then, a ranger
spots a wandering door while deep in the forest or a postal
knight sees one running across the Gale Fields. Since no one
has got close enough to a door to give a solid description,
there’s a good deal of speculation around if there is only
one door or if there are multiple doors. To this day, no one
really knows who enchanted these doors and no one has
been able to catch one to study it.

330

Leap! The Wandering Door leaps 60 feet vertically into
the air.
Shake! The Wandering Door shakes violently. All creatures on top of the Wandering Door must succeed on a
DC 19 Strength saving throw or be thrown away from
the door, landing prone in an unoccupied space within
10 feet of it.

Reactions
Flee!!! If a creature moves within 30 feet of the
Wandering Door, it moves up to 100 feet.
Shake! When a creature lands on top of the Wandering
Door, the door shakes violently. All creatures on top of
the Wandering Door must succeed on a DC 19 Strength
saving throw or be thrown away from the door, landing
prone in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it.

Root Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 15
ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.
Watching Eye (Recharge 6). The terrifying gaze of
a watchwood tree can leave a creature frozen in its
tracks. Each creature of the watchwood tree’s choice
within a 15-foot cone must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom
saving throw or become restrained; a creature that
can’t be frightened automatically succeeds on its
saving throw. The watchwood tree can then immediately make a Root Slam attack against each creature
that failed its saving throw.
A creature restrained in this way can use its action to
make a DC 12 Wisdom check, freeing itself on a success.

False Appearance. If the watchwood tree is motionless
at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn’t observed the
watchwood tree move or act, that creature
must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence
(Investigation) check to discern that
the watchwood tree isn’t an
ordinary tree.

Watchwood
Tree

Appearing as one of the island’s many
deciduous trees, the watchwood is known
for terrorizing small settlements and villages
throughout the Gift of Shuritashi. Their presence
alone is enough to stop trade and travel to a location,
which is why skilled woodcutters are often employed all
over the island. Though watchwood trees can be dangerous, they’re more of a threat during the warmer seasons, as
they’re easily spotted during the winter, when they’re the
only tree with leaves still on it.

Witch

Local Arcana Expert

Witches are found all over Obojima and are well respected
amongst the people. Both covens and their members play a
major role in the economy and ecosystem of the island.

Witches are often seen as important members of the
community, as they’re understanding of magic is often
desperately needed on an island full of magical happenings
and peculiar occurrences. If a witch were to visit a town
without a local magician, they would assuredly be buttered
up and pampered during their stay.

The six major covens of Obojima have lived harmoniously
(for the most part) for the last 50 years, working alongside

Besides their regional ingredient expertise, each coven
claims to have a unique set of skills that differentiates them
from the others. But if you were to ask any islander, they’d
probably struggle to tell you what those qualities are.

MYSTERIES, HISTORY,
AND MORE

he following chapter is for Game Masters only. For all you Players who are intrigued to read this section on the
mysteries of Obojima, heed this warning. There are moments in life when temptation beckons us with honeyed
whispers to enter into domains that we know are not for our eyes—this is one of those moments. A huge part of
adventuring in the world of Obojima is to relish its mysteries and delight in the unknown, and beyond here, the magic
tricks are revealed, the illusions are dispelled, and the mysteries all laid bare. So, for those who tend to buckle under the
weight of resisting the siren’s call to lay eyes on forbidden texts (and you know who you are), go no further! Let the GM
be the one to reveal these secrets to you and enjoy weaving many tales filled with surprises and revelations that are sure
to tickle your cortex, warm your heart, and fill your mind with awe.

FULL DISCLOSURE
This book is the first in a series of books that we are planning in and beyond the island of Obojima. Not only do we have
much more to reveal and elaborate on about Obojima itself, but we also have other islands that we are planning on revealing,
each with its own cultures and intrigues.
If you are planning on telling a grand Obojima story (and we hope that some of you are) then to connect this Obojima book
to the next book we’re planning (that we’ve aptly named, “Book 2”), then we have left directions in the “Author’s Notes”
section, on how to reveal and solve the big mysteries and problems of Obojima in such a way that your story will seamlessly
fit with what’s coming in Book 2.
As stated, the answers to these mysteries are so that they make that seamless fit with the future material we’re planning.
But, if you have other ideas as to what the answers to these mysteries are or if you want to leave them mysterious, is
completely up to you. Obojima is yours to do with as you wish and how you wind up changing it is entirely up to you.
With that, let us proceed into the mysteries of Obojima!

The Mysteries
of Obojima
Every village and location on Obojima has its own unique
mysteries particular to that place—a missing magic wok,
a strange wishing well, a mystical tree—but there are the
main mysteries that almost all Obojimans are grappling
with, and they are:
1. The Island of Obojima
2. The earthquake and tsunami
3. The Corruption
4. What is beyond the horizon
5. The origins of the “First Age” technology
6. The origins of the dara
7. The apocryphal legends of the Nakudama
8. The wandering forest
While we are going to reveal what is behind the curtain,
what you do with the information is up to you. There is
power in leaving things a mystery, so these answers do not
have to be revealed and can be just for your edification.

What is Obojima?
Like any island, most of Obojima is underwater, its base
being much broader than the land that is above the surface.
But what no one on the island knows is that Obojima, up
until the earthquake, actually moved across the ocean floor,
wandering the ocean.
How it moves is yet to be discovered as no one has gone
out far enough beyond the Shallows or dived deep enough
to see the base of the island. If someone was to make this
journey, who knows what they would find?
Before it stopped moving, Obojima roamed in a migration
pattern that kept it from colliding with other islands that
are in the ocean of this world. Some places, like the AHA
observatory, may have evidence of this motion, through

observing the constellations. Other places, like the Coastal
Diver’s Lodge, may have observations about how the
current has significantly slowed down.
Is Obojima alive? Obojima is magical and some say that
the island has a spirit or is a spirit itself; how true that
statement is, is entirely up to you.

The Earthquake and Tsunami
The earthquake and the tsunami have seemingly caused
strange things to occur on Obojima, and some have begun
to speculate that the earthquake is responsible for many
of the odd things that have happened to the island and its
surrounding environment. Here are some of the most interesting observations:
◊ Obojiman astronomers and dedicated skygazers have
noticed that since the earthquake, the star patterns that
once migrated across the sky in all kinds of ways, sometimes disappearing for many years before emerging again,
have now begun to rise and set in very predictable paths
across the night’s sky.
◊ There once was a strong current that ran from the eastern
side of the island to the west which suddenly stopped
after the earthquake. There’s evidence of this anecdotally
from fisherfolk but there’s also the story of Master Chen’s
Water Clock—a giant tower built in the Shallows outside
of Sky Kite Valley where the current turned a wheel that
ran a very precise clock. Since the earthquake, the current
has slowed dramatically and the clock has ceased to keep
time.

What Actually Happened
The earthquake was the result of the island crashing into
a massive tendral of Corruption deep underwater. The
sudden stop caused the tsunami that swept across the eastern side of the island and eventually saw to the rise of the
Corruption that is now affecting the land. This inital impact
has also halted the island’s momentum, as Obojima is now
being held by that same tendril.

335

The Corruption
Most Obojimans that hear of the Corruption believe that
it is the result of an angry spirit, so a traveler might see
any number of coastal villages making apologies to the
Great Sea Spirit or offering incense to the giant flying koi
fish in hopes that their wrath will be appeased. Any other
islanders, especially those in the midlands or even a very
few westerners who have heard rumors, they are likely to
believe the same, and even though they see no evidence of
the Corruption, they most likely make offerings to the spirits “just to be sure”—an Obojiman motto is, “It’s always a
good idea to make friends, especially with the Spirit Realm.”
For those who have seen the Corruption first hand, the
feeling of trepidation is more visceral and existential. Many
of those who were first to the site of the Corruption, the
rangers, now bear the mark of its magic and are the ones
most likely to feel the urgency to spread word of this very
real danger. Druids will fear for the forests and beasts as
the Corruption spares no living thing. The elves will feel
grave concern for the spirits as the Corruption’s foul magic
extends into the Spirit Realm as well, turning spirits into
twisted demons.

336

For those on the front line of the Corruption, the danger
is unknown and there is no cure. It is also known that the
Corruption is spreading and no one knows how long
Obojima has before it is entirely consumed.

Corruption in a Nutshell
◊ The Corruption is a fairly recent development that
happened three months ago.
◊ A great earthquake shook the entire island and then a
tsunami hit the east coast of Obojima.
◊ After the tsunami, the Corruption emerged from the
ocean and piled up on the shore, despoiling the once pristine sands of Shusha Beach on the east coast of Obojima.
◊ From there, it slowly began to spread across the land,
transforming everything in its path. Lush and beautiful
forests were turned into bizarre versions, nay, mockeries,
of their former selves.
◊ Creatures and spirits were not immune to the Corruption,
and now huddle amid the twisted boughs and blighted
canopies of corrupted forests—confused, bewildered, and
some, enraged by the Corruption’s weirding ways.

◊ If exposed to its foul magic, humans, elves, Nakudama,
and dara are affected by the Corruption in a variety of
different ways, but all of them result in the Corruption
staining the skin and seeping from the pores. Many of the
rangers who first came to examine the Corruption were
afflicted in this way, but along with the suffering of the
flesh, many of them experienced supernatural powers.
◊ Because the Corruption’s arrival happened so suddenly
and because many Obojimans are homebodies, not many
locals west of Mount Arbora have even heard about it.
◊ There are rumors that certain covens of witches foretold
its coming and began to prepare—some covens bracing
for the worst, and others cackling with delight at the
potential for a wondrous new ingredient for their virulent
brews and ghastly potions.
◊ Nobody seems to know where it came from or what it is.

are legends and stories that abound of what's beyond the
island. There are some archeologists who say that during
the time of the ancient Nakudama, Obojima was once a part
of a larger island and, in an attempt to save the kingdom
from a terrible downfall, a wizard cast a spell that broke
Obojima off and saved it from a fate worse than death.
In the past, intrepid Obojiman explorers, adventurers,
and oddballs have indulged their curiosity in knowing what
lies beyond the Shallows by taking leave of Obojima’s
shores and sailing beyond the outer reef in makeshift ships,
arcane flying devices, and even spirit-powered vessels. Most
of them get far enough to feel the overwhelming immensity
of the oceanic horizon and quickly return. Any small boats
or ships that have sunk in the deep waters beyond the
outer edge of the Shallows disappear into the depths and
are never recovered.

What is the Corruption, Actually?
The Corruption is a toxic substance from another world.
It’s bubbled up from the ocean floor, growing to the point
of being large enough to bring the island of Obojima to a
complete halt, unable to move further unless it is reduced
in size or removed entirely.
The Corruption has no more consciousness than a slime
mold or a fungus that blindly seeks its food in a freakishly
efficient manner and it has as much of an agenda as a
tornado or a lava flow—it is a neutral force of nature with
no inherent malice.

Ultimately, how you use the Corruption in your
story is up to you. The truth will be revealed by
us in time. In anticipation of the expansions to
Obojima and its story, we have two suggestions
that deal with the Corruption and how to best end
your story to properly set up for the next book.
Here’s what you’ll need to set up:
The Corruption needs to be severed from the
island and a portion of it must remain dormant
within the Brackwater Wetlands.

Obojima best suits adventures that are of smaller
stature. Our intent is for stories told here to be
about its people, its magics, and its mysteries. We
wanted to have everything contained so that the
stories told here could be small, cozy, magical, and
compact—little charming tales of witches, quirky
occurrences, and strange events. For the purposes
of this setting, we wanted to keep the adventures
on the island and not about setting out on the
open ocean to go somewhere other than Obojima.
To keep curious players and adventurers on the
island, feel free to tell tales of monsters out in the
open ocean that can swallow whole ships the way
a seagull scarfs down a sandwich or give them a
strong emotional connection to someone or something on the island. There are many fun ways to
keep your players from wandering too far.

What is Actually Beyond the Horizon
The world is an ocean planet on which many islands exist.

The Corruption can’t be caused by a person or a
creature. It’s a natural force that has existed in
the ocean for some time.

Most of the islands on this archipelago world move the
way Obojima does, travelling on a set migrational path,
never to connect with each other. Each of these islands
have their own cultures, some of them—like Obojima—
have developed in relative isolation, their island always
wandering and rarely or never crossing near enough to
another island to see it on the horizon.

The World Beyond the Horizon

Although there are multiple islands moving across the
planet’s oceans, they somehow don’t collide, as if there is
some spirit or instinct at work that keeps them apart.

Most Obojimans are very content with their pastoral lives
on the island and think little about what is out beyond the
horizon of the seemingly endless ocean. They are more
interested in cooking their next amazing dish, herding
their sheep dragons for the seasonal shearing, or winning
the pie eating contest in the upcoming festival. But there

Obojima is one of this world’s smallest islands.

337

Why Is There 80s Technology
on Obojima?
It’s one of the first questions any player who comes to
Obojima is going to be wondering. What is known is that
these items appeared long before the Nakudama first set a
webbed foot on the island. The most ancient wood carvings, cave paintings, and temple murals show images of
this technology existing during the beginning of recorded
history. Sacred scrolls written by Nakudama sages speak of
these strange and wonderful objects and describe some of
their myriad uses by harnessing spirit energy.
As a GM telling an Obojima story, you will have to have
answers to questions like: Where did all this 80s tech come
from? Can we use it? Is there electricity on the island?
What do the people of Obojima think of this stuff?

As the GM, you can make all the player’s dreams come
true, or you can leave them with more questions than
answers, but here are some speculations of how this
strange occurrence came to be.

In-World Theories
On Obojima, no one knows how it all got there, but everyone has an opinion about these devices and buildings that
have always been a part of Obojima’s landscape ever since
anyone can remember. Part of the fun is inventing all the
various myths, legends, and tall tales that locals have to
explain the mysterious origins of the 80s tech.
Even though these random artifacts of the 1980s have
been on Obojima for millennia, they are all in pristine
condition—somehow magically preserved. A vending
machine might have been passed down for centuries and

still show no wear and tear, a small convenient storefront
might look as if it was built yesterday while a building in
the next village is moss-covered and decrepit. No one
knows why these artifacts do not age and decay, but that is
a part of the magic mystery that is Obojima.
As to where it all came from, well, Obojimans are happy
to voice their wide array of opinions on the matter. Here are
a few examples:
◊ An extra-dimensional rift barfed these strange objects on
the island.
◊ A wizard’s spell that went awry.
◊ The Nakudama queen, Okumi, brought them with her
from another world millennia ago.
◊ A collection of otherworldly objects left by an elder spirit.
◊ The spirits were bored and created these toys to keep
themselves busy while in the mundane realm.
◊ Long ago a great empire built these tools and structures,
but have since fallen from grace.

Who Was the First Dara?
Long before the Great Earthquake that brought the Corruption, the first of the dara walked out of the forest of Roa
Kala. This being was initially thought to be a spirit by the
people of Obojima, but they soon found out that “Dara”, as
the being called itself, was as flesh and blood as they were
and not a spirit at all.
As to who the First Dara was, the details are few, and
most of what is known is anecdotal, handed down through
several generations, but this being known as Dara, wandered
the island of Obojima, telling stories and spreading wisdom.
To this day, it is widely held that Dara was an avatar of the
island spirit, and many humans, elves, and Nakudama hold
the First Dara in high regard as a being to be revered.
In their wanderings, Dara was known to have inscribed
magic glyphs into certain trees that were instructions to
future dara that would soon emerge from the forest like
their predecessor. The First Dara said that all those who
followed would gain knowledge by being in this world and
by reading the magic glyphs that the First Dara was inscribing into trees across the island.
After wandering for several years, Dara returned to their
forest from where they emerged and built a village called
Roa Kala. This was to become the first place a dara would see
when they came to be from within one of the sacred trees.
Where dara came from before emerging from a tree is
still a mystery, even to the dara themselves, but, as they
do, Obojimans speculate. Many still believe that, on some
level, the dara are connected to the spirit of the island,
and thus they are instinctually treated with respect by the
locals. Because of this belief, some Obojimans will ask dara
questions of a spiritual or shamanic nature such as: “Will
it be a good season for growing beans this year?” “Will my
prized ox get better?” or “What is happening with all the sky

fish?” erroneously thinking that all dara somehow know the
secrets and mystical ways of the island.

What is Actually the Case?
Where dara come from is a true mystery. As the GM, you
are free to invent any possibility that fits your version of
Obojima, but for now, the origin of the dara is firmly within
the realm of the unknown.

The History of the Nakudama
Nakudama legend says that in ancient days, the queen
of the Nakudama, Okumi, came to Obojima as a tadpole,
having swum across the great cosmic ocean to reach the tip
of Mount Arbora. Once atop the mountain, she transformed
herself by absorbing her magic tail that had propelled her
across the cosmos, and with that power, she lifted the rest
of the island of Obojima above the surface of the waves.
She then created within herself 1000 eggs and sought out
a suitable place to spawn them. It is said that, after she laid
her eggs, a shower of falling stars fell upon them and from
these came the first royal dynasty of demi-god-frogs, from
whom the rest of the Nakudama would spawn. She taught
the first of the Nakudama the sacred tongue of Naku-Naku,
taught them how to plant crops and till the soil. She taught
them laws of how to conduct themselves and to seek out
what is best in life.
From the primordial waters many beasts and foul
monsters coveted her island paradise and emerged to destroy
Obojima or take it for themselves. The 10,000 Headed Hydra
was the first of her challengers, which she decapitated with
one great lash from her magic tongue. The second to emerge
from the abyss of the ocean was the Great Terror Crab, which
she crushed in a cleverly devised trap. This ingenuity would
be a trait greatly admired and fostered in all her children.
Legend says that it was the queen who first discovered
the strange artifacts from another world and sought to
gather them. She sent her best warriors across Obojima to
collect a cache of these prizes for her most erudite wizards
to study. To this day, the fabled cache of First Age objects
has never been discovered.
She is said to have allowed her favorite consort, Okka, to
perish so that all Nakudama could benefit from a healing
mushroom that is now found all across Obojima, a mushroom that was named the Queen’s Dilemma in honor of her
sacrifice. From this fabled act, the Nakudama derive their
sense of community and selflessness, that all joys should be
shared, not hoarded.
At some point in the historical record, the queen was no
more. Some legends say she vanished, others say she died,
some say she went back to the cosmic sea and will one day
return to Obojima. After her departure, the royal dynasties
of the Nakudama began their rule, building an empire that
spanned the island and would stand for a thousand years
before it fractured at the hands of Oghmai.

The Demon Emperor

Malgrotha: A Spirit in Two Realms

Legend says that the demon emperor, Oghmai, orchestrated the kingdom's fall by sowing the seeds of division
among the Nakudama, preying on tribal grievances and
petty squabbles until it boiled over into all-out war. Oghmai
claimed a brief, brutal reign, however, under the guidance
of sage Shalwin, a growing band of resilient Nakudama
eventually overthrew Oghmai, and thereafter disbanded
the monarchy to forge a new, peaceful society in the lands
untouched by the war.

Malgrotha was once a twin spirit, a crow of darkness and
a rabbit of light, that lived within the Spirit Realm. They
were like two sides of the same coin, each balancing the
other. But one day the rabbit was shot in the heart by a
cursed arrow. This wound split the twin spirit, and while
the rabbit writhed in agony in the Spirit Realm, the crow
was thrust into the Physical Realm, warped into a ravening
demon, and became Malgrotha.

Nakudama Now
In the present day, the first queen and the ancient royal
lineage of the Nakudama has fallen into legend and myth.
There are many Nakudama ruins dotted around the island
where one can study and see evidence of this once great
dynasty. The Nakudama themselves have varied feelings
about their past. Some are curious about their heritage and
are avid adventurers and archaeologists, while others are
content to let the past drift into the past and simply enjoy
the pleasures of the present.

What is Actually the Case?
Are these legends true? Nakudama myth sure says they all
are, but we all know how nakudma like to stretch the truth.

No one knows who wounded the rabbit spirit or why, but
while the wounded rabbit remained in the Spirit Realm, the
material manifestation of the spirit’s pain and rage—the
shambling crow-thing—began to terrorize Obojima,
expressing its anguish.

Nature of Malgrotha
Malgrotha is mindless with rage and because of this, it
cannot scheme or devise a way out of its ever-changing
prison—the Crawling Canopy. Thus, it is doomed to wander
within the woods, never finding freedom.
Malgrotha cannot be reasoned with and will tear apart
anything within its path. Every so often, it will claw at its
body in rage, tearing off a chunk of its own flesh which
then turns into a smaller mutated version of itself. These
“children” also roam the forest, compelled to search for
Dara, who is long since gone from this world.

Origin of the Crawling Canopy
The story of the forest’s origin is not widely known among
Obojimans, however, there are a few on the island who
know its origin and purpose: that the Crawling Canopy
was created by the First Dara 300 years ago as a prison to
contain a demon—a hideous crow-like monster known only
as “Malgrotha”.

What is Actually the Case?
After the First Dara emerged from the forest of Roa Kala
to explore Obojima, they left behind a multitude of glyphs
for those dara who would come after. But around that same
time, as if bound by fate, the demon, Malgrotha, was also
terrorizing the land and would eventually come head to
head with the wandering nomad.
The First Dara and Malgrotha engaged in a fierce battle
that lasted days, both of them dealing horrendous wounds
to one another, but due to its demonic nature, Malgrotha’s
wounds would swiftly heal while those of the First Dara
would not. In a final act, the First Dara imprinted his life
force into a copse of trees with a pure, powerful magic.
Instantly, the trees awakened and encircled Malgrotha, and
from then on, wherever Malgrotha would go, the trees
would form a natural barrier around it. The forest became
known as the Crawling Canopy, and it took Malgrotha to
the Gale Fields and has been a mobile prison for Malgrotha
to this very day.

Adventures

ADVENTURE: THE
CURIOUS WORLD WITHIN

T

"The Curious World Within” is intended for 2 to 4 2nd-level characters.

he adventurers have decided to help out a young postal knight and find themselves shrunk to the size of a mouse
when they infiltrate a witch’s workshop in hopes of procuring a letter. As they navigate the strange landscape,
they’ll have to fend off bora bugs, handle pixie tricksters, talk to a giant cat, and perhaps even fight a giant Venus
fly rat that calls the witch’s bizarre workshop home.

342

Adventure Begins!
As they wander through Okiri Village, the party hears the
sound of weeping. When they investigate, they find Lomi,
a 13 year old boy, sitting on a stone across from a small,
wooden house with his head in his hands. Next to him is
a sad-looking pack mule loaded with several sacks, each
marked with the insignia of the Courier Brigade.

Lomi’s Dilemma
Lomi is the younger brother of Ashi, a knight of the Courier
Brigade. All his young life, he’s wanted to be a postal
knight and impress his older sister. When one of the postal
knights fell ill, Ashi entrusted her little brother to deliver
their packages and letters as a first test of his commitment
to the organization—it was Lomi’s big chance!
Unfortunately for Lomi, he has delivered the letter to the
wrong residence, and now he can’t get inside to retrieve the
goods. Lomi laments that if he returns and admits that he’s
delivered the letter to the wrong address, his dreams of
being a postal knight are sure to be over.
If asked, Lomi says that all he knows about this place is
that it is the workshop of Miss Lindley, but the letter was
intended for Mrs. Linfrey—an honest mistake, that’s now
led to a giant dilemma.
There’s a chance (DC 14 Intelligence check) that one of
the adventurers might have heard of Miss Lindley—the
local witch of the small village and the resident fixer and
mender of goods. You can read more on Miss Lindley in the
Locations Chapter under “Okiri Village—NPCs” section.
Any witch or warlock in the party will have advantage on
the roll.

Lomi’s Offer
Although Lomi has little to offer as a young boy away from
his home, he’s absolutely desperate and at this moment is
willing to offer more than what he has. Lomi can't give the
adventures much besides a few sea petals and a couple of
non-magical First Age trinkets. He will however offer his
services as an assistant for a short time, and if he really
needs to, the gold flowers he would earn for delivering
the letter.

Approaching Miss Lindley’s
Workshop
Miss Lindley’s workshop is a small and humble wooden
house in Okiri Village. There is a little cobble path that
leads to the front door, which is painted a bright green. A
sign that hangs above the door reads “closed” written in
faded cursive. On either side of the front entrance are Boom
Beri bushes, which have been picked clean of fruit. The
windows all across the house have been frosted over, and
numerous birds have begun to nest on the tiled roof.

Some facts about the workshop:
◊ Although it looks seemingly mundane, the workshop is
magical. Beside the fact that it is invulnerable, it has a
variety of spells and enchantments that Miss Lindley has
placed on it over the years.
◊ Besides the doors and windows there are no other
entrances into the house. The house has no chimney or
other small entrances.
◊ A powerful enchantment keeps the home's entrances
fully locked. This enchantment only lifts when Miss
Lindley is on the premises. This is true for all windows
and doors besides the padlocked double door to the cellar,
which is found in the back of the house. Many years ago
Miss Lindley had heaps of potion ingredients delivered
to her home regularly, letting them in through the cellar
doors when she wasn’t around. These deliveries stopped
some time ago, which is why the cellar doors now see
little use and are covered in ivy.

Entering the Workshop
There are three main ways to enter the workshop:
1. Through the ivy-covered double door that leads into
the cellar.
2. Through one of the windows.
3. Through the front door.
Although any of these options are available to the
adventurers, the padlocked double door to the cellar is the
easiest route inside. It is non-magical and takes a successful
DC 13 Dexterity check to pick the lock. It can also be broken
off with a successful attack vs. AC 13.
The windows and front door are magically locked and
require some method of dispelling magic to briefly enter. It
is difficult at their level, but it is not impossible, so be
prepared for clever adventurers to skip past the cellar,
staircase, and Emerson the cat, as they would jump straight
to the workshop's Main Floor.

The Shrink
As soon as all the party members enter the house, they are
shrunk down to Tiny size via a powerful magic trap left by
Miss Lindley while she’s away. When that happens, all the
open doors and windows shut themselves, and the house
magically re-locks itself.
If party members stay outside on guard, then they will
remain their normal size unless they decide to enter, at
which time, they will become Tiny sized.
The stat blocks in this adventure are all designed to be
relative to the character’s Tiny size.

343

1 square = 5 feet

Entering the Cellar
If the party enters from the double door outside, they see a
flight of wooden stairs going down. As they begin to walk
down, read the following:

This shadowy cellar smells of damp earth and
some pungent, unrecognizable odor—perhaps
from the centuries of bubbling concoctions that
now stain the earthen floor.
Magic flames flicker within soot-caked lanterns
that hang on the walls, each casting an eerie
glow upon old wooden crates and rows of sagging
shelves that hold all manner of dust-covered
bottles and curios—some of which are covered
in sackcloth. As the last of you steps off the
staircase, the ground illuminates in sporadic
arcane glyphs that cover the cellar floor. In an
instant your perspective warps, your eyes blur
before focusing once more on the world around
you. As you look about you quickly conclude that
you’ve either shrunk down to the size of a mouse
or this house is a lot more spacious inside than
you initially anticipated.

344

Moments after the adventurers shrink down to Tiny, the
doors magically shut and lock behind them, dust falling
from the ceiling above as they do.

Inside the Cellar
The cellar serves as Miss Lindley’s catch all room. It stores
old projects, spare supplies, and potion ingredients she
rarely uses.
A search of the crates and shelves reveals:
◊ Paw prints and claw marks from what appears to be a cat,
which as a Tiny creature seem massive.
◊ Spoiled and unfinished elixirs and potions.
◊ An uncommon ingredient from a region other than the
Gift of Shuritashi.
◊ An old, broken First Age trinket.
If the adventurers are not overly cautious and make a
ruckus, their activity will alert Emerson, the Witch’s Cat
(see Emerson the Cat later on this page). Once alerted,
Emerson will (depending on how hungry he is) either
skulk over to investigate or wait lazily atop his cushion
while idly licking a paw.

1 square = 5 feet

The Staircase

Emerson, the Witch’s Cat

To leave the cellar, the adventurers must travel up the staircase opposite to where they came in from, read the following:

Emerson is an imperious cat who boasts a portly paunch,
crooked whiskers, and a coat of thick fur that sticks out
at all angles which makes him always look as if he’s just
woken up. Emerson has the run of the workshop, but
prefers the hallway and basement where he can be away
from the pesky pixies and stalk any vermin that try to
invade his domain.

What would ordinarily be a normal staircase
is now a series of towering steps, each one about
15 feet tall that lead up to a landing piled with
books and boxes.

This flight of rickety wooden stairs connects the cellar
and the main floor of the workshop. At the top of the stairs
is the hallway and Emerson’s cushion.

BUG ATTACK!
If you choose, while the adventurers strenuously climb
the stairs they are ambushed by 1d4+1 bora bugs (see
“Monsters” below for stat block) that crawl from cracks in
the walls.

Emerson generally can be found sleeping at the top of the
stairs, which connect the cellar to the hallway that leads to
the workshop. Like a dragon guarding its lair, Emerson sits
atop a comfortable cushion embroidered with his name.
Emerson uses the stats of a Lion* with an intelligence of 11.

Emerson and the Pixies
Emerson has a strained relationship with the pixies that
live on the main floor, as each tries to be the favorite of
Miss Lindley. Miss Lindley heaps oodles of attention to both
the pixies and Emerson, but once she leaves, the feuding
between the pixies and Emerson begins.
In the most recent episode of the feud, the pixies have
taken Emerson’s treats and hid them atop the bookcase in
the main workshop—a place that Emerson can’t get to.

345

What Emerson Knows
If Emerson is befriended, he barters knowledge. He knows
which potion on the work table upstairs will restore the
adventurer’s size, and he may even know what some of the
other items in the workshop do.
If Emerson trusts the party, he will give his information
up front so that once the party is restored to normal size,
they can get him his treats. If he doesn’t trust the party,
Emerson holds back his knowledge of the potion, only
telling the party once his treats are safely in his paws.

Workshop Main Floor
This is the main area where Miss Lindley fixes all kinds of
farm tools and some First Age artifacts like bicycles and
sunglasses. Although there are no such items in here now,
there are an array of tools hanging from the walls which
are used by Miss Lindley in her craft.
There are three areas on the workshop’s main floor:
4. The Hallway
5. The Bookcase
6. The Witch’s Worktable

Once they become aware of the adventurers, the pixies
are overjoyed and immediately begin to invent games to
play with them, casting spells (like Confusion*) at the
party as they try to navigate the giant workshop.
Tina and Meena might take bets on who Emerson will eat
or who will get to the table top first. All the while their
buzzing wings and invisible laughter can be heard from all
corners of the workshop, adding another level of irritation
for the party.
With a word, the pixies can magically close all the shutters
and douse the candles, plunging the workshop into darkness.

The Hallway
The narrow hallway is piled with old books, papers, jars,
and other various clutter. To a tiny creature, traveling along
here would be a perilous affair, like crossing through a
canyon with unstable cliffs.
If the party irks the pixies and gets on their bad sides,
they are not above causing a cascade of heavy books to fall
on them for the fun of it.
Emerson may also knock a stack of books over by
accident (especially if he’s startled) causing an avalanche
that could damage a tiny party.

There is also a small end table, on top is a cage that
contains a venus fly rat (see “Monsters” below).

Tabitha Turnip
Miss Lindley is helped by a turnip spirit called Tabitha.
Tabitha is chronically grumpy and dour and only reveals
herself to clean up spills, put out fires, or deal with any such
forms of chaos that could cause damage or destruction to the
workshop. Tabitha does her tasks in a slow and deliberate
manner, all the while paying no mind to the world around
her. She responds (if at all) with eye rolls, sighs, and side
long glances of mild displeasure. Even the pixies fail to get
under her thick skin.
Tabitha is the only one who knows beyond all
doubt, every magic item in the workshop.
Getting her to help identify every one is a
task worthy of the greatest of heroes.

Pesky Pixies
There are two giant pixies
(see giant pixie stat block
in “Monsters” section below)
here named Teena and Meena,
and they are essentially tricksy
agents of mischief and mayhem
who may taunt and tease the adventurers if
it pleases them or lead the party astray and
cause doubt. You can also have the pixies
be less mischievous and actually help the party to
identify the scores of magic trinkets here (although
they make stuff up half the time).

346

AVALANCHE!
If an avalanche of books, crates, jars, or papers happens,
any creature in the affected area falls prone, and they must
make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, taking 1d10 bludgeoning damage and retraining the character on a failed save.
If you chose to not have the bora bugs attack on the
stairway, they could also attack after an avalanche in
the hallway.

The Bookcase
This is a tall bookcase that is filled with papers, notebooks,
and dusty tomes that Miss Lindley has amassed
over the years. Most of the books are heady manuscripts about the art of witchcraft.
Also on the bookcase is:
◊ 1 cassette with the spell Vegetable Blade stored
inside it (as if a scroll).
◊ The potion recipe for Elder Elixir. (Ingredients
needed: Spindle Leg Spider Webs, Origami Crane,
and Brush Reed.)
◊ The letter addressed to Mrs. Linfrey that Lomi has
misplaced. The pixies have put it here.
◊ At the top of the bookcase is a sachet embroidered
with the name “Emerson” on it. Inside are a cluster
of pungent smelling cat treats.

1 square = 2 inches

Witch’s Work Table

The Venus Fly Rat

In the center of the room is a large work table that is
covered with the tools of Miss Lindley’s arcane trade. It is
here that the adventures will find the elixir that will return
them to normal. Though to find it amongst the collection
of potions is no easy task. By trial and error, or through
the help of the Pixies or Emerson, the correct bottle can be
identified. However the real danger of the workshop is lurking just around the corner.

Hiding amongst the mess is the recently freed Venus Fly
Rat (see giant venus fly rat stat block in “Monsters” section
below), a creature originally intended to be used as an ingredient that now serves as a dangerous threat for the adventurers as they search for the potion on top of the workshop table.

Getting on the Table
To get on to the table where the elixer is, the party will
have to climb up the (relative to them) 60-foot tall wooden
table legs and navigate the overhang to get onto the surface
of the table top. Any player character with a climbing speed
can make it to the top without issue, all other characters
must succeed a DC 14 Strength Athletics check.
Getting on to the table should be fraught with difficulty,
but to make it even harder you can have the pixies cause all
kinds of mayhem during the climb. Going as far as a brief
and playful combat.

Player characters with a Passive Perception of 14 or higher
will notice the venus fly rat before it notices them. Otherwise the fly rat attacks the moment an unsuspecting
adventurer gets close to the center of the table.

Bubbling Cauldron
A small iron cauldron bubbles over a low heat from a First
Age propane burner. Inside the cauldron is an arcane
mixture of herbs, liquids, and magic. It smells aromatic and
changes with every inhalation so that exactly what herb or
spice was used can never quite be grasped.
When approached by a Tiny creature, the cauldron sits
atop a large, metal platform from the center of which a
circle of blue flames hiss and lick the underside of the
cauldron making it hot to the touch. The rim of the
cauldron is 15-feet (relative) off the table top.

347

If an adventurer drinks the brew or finds themselves
inside of the liquid, they must roll a d6.
◊ On a 1: Everything is Funny. For the next hour, the
character can’t help cracking up. They have disadvantage
on any roll unless they can succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence check to keep from laughing like a hyena.
◊ On a 2-4: Harness the Wind. The character is
surrounded by billowing gusts of wind that they can
use like a feather fall spell to cushion a fall. The potion’s
effects last for 5 minutes.
◊ On a 5-6: Touch of Nature. The character becomes
infused with what some might say is the spirit of
Obojima, allowing them to cast the spell Pillar of Force
once before the effects of the potion fade. The spell casting modifier for pillar of force is Intelligence, Wisdom, or
Charisma (whichever is higher)

List of Potions
Besides the potion that will return the adventures to their
normal size, the following potions can be found on Miss
Lindley’s table.

COMMON COMBAT POTIONS
◊ Candlecap
◊ Heroism

COMMON UTILITY POTIONS
◊ Flip and Skip
◊ Cat’s Eye

COMMON WHIMSICAL POTIONS
◊ Bubble Message
◊ Merriment
◊ Melodious Bird Calls
◊ Ladybug Kinship
◊ Beard Brew

348

Escape!
If all goes well, the adventurers return to normal after
drinking the correct potion, they retrieve Mrs. Linfrey’s
letter, and escape the workshop without a hitch. Lomi is
overjoyed and thanks the party profusely.
If you wish to continue the adventure and spin it into
your next story plot, then Lomi could mention that Mrs.
Linfrey’s letter still needs to be delivered and ask if the
party would deliver it for him as he has lost his confidence.
You can also have Lomi accompany the party as an NPC
until the letter is delivered. In either case, this can set up
your next adventure as Mrs. Linfrey can live in another city
and take the party on a new adventure.

Mrs. Linfrey’s Letter
If the party chooses to open the letter, Lomi will be horrified and do his best to dissuade them from doing such a
dishonorable act. He will report them to the Courier Brigade
which will have consequences in later adventures.
The letter could have several options of what it contains.
◊ Could be a letter that hooks into your next adventure.
◊ It could be a confession (of love or a misdeed) that leads
to a new tale.
◊ Could be an invitation to a secret witch’s costume ball.

Monsters

Giant Pixie

The following are the creatures that are found in this
adventure. The stat blocks have been adjusted relative to
the party being Tiny creatures.

Giant Bora Bug
Mostly found in dense forests, Bora Bugs are natural engineers, using their sharp horns and spiked wing casings to
carve out intricate paths on the earth. They work in large
colonies, scouring smooth, winding trails. These paths
often lead to hidden clearings, ancient ruins, or secret
groves where forest spirits dwell. But bora bugs can also
carve a path through houses and stone walls which is why
many Obojimans see them as pests.

The pixies that inhabit the workshop are sweet as pie when
Miss Lindley is around, but when she leaves for town, they
get up to all kinds of mischief—especially with Emerson,
who they love (and love to tease).

Flying speed, as long as the Pixie is holding its breath.
The Pixie can hold its breath for a number of minutes
equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30
seconds). The Pixie can only grant this effect to one
creature at a time, and when the effect ends, it must
wait 1 minute before using it again.

throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

ADVENTURE:
BELOW THE SHALLOWS

T

“Below The Shallows” is intended for 2 to 4 4th-level characters.

he adventurers are called to help a young boy recover his grandfather’s kite-plane, which was hijacked by fish folk
and crashed into the Shallows. The adventurers must now dive to the ocean floor, explore a mysterious sunken
town, find the kite-plane, and then bargain (or fight) with a host of fish folk pirates, before returning to the young
boy before his grandfather finds out.

Adventure Prologue
This adventure's inciting incident doesn't actually occur until
later in this chapter. Still, to make for a more impactful story
we recommend having the adventurers meet some of the
supporting characters before they’re asked to help them.
To do this, the prologue should take place on a dirt road
leading to Sky Kite Valley. Perhaps the adventurers are
going to the village to attend one of the grand kite festivals,
to see the mass migration of floating jellyfish, or perhaps
even deliver the letter given to them at the end of “The
Curious World Within” adventure. Whatever the reason, it is
on this dirt road where the story begins.

Attack of the Harpies
As the adventurers are traveling, a band of harpies are
tracking them, waiting for the right time to strike. The
number of harpies should be enough to make the party
think twice about fighting (2 to 3 harpies per player). As the
harpies swoop down they land on the road in front of them
and then try to intimidate the adventurers to give up their
loot without a fight.

351

Aerial Assistance
Whether a fight breaks out or the adventurers are considering handing over their valuables, a noise comes from
overhead as a flying machine—a kite-plane—comes to the
party’s aid. The kite-plane is piloted by a young boy, Tokko
(human, male, commoner*), and his grandfather known as
Gramps (human, male, commoner*).
The combat goes as follows:
◊ Gramps hurls down Bottled Bombs (common combat
potion) as Tokko skillfully navigates the kite-plane.
◊ For non-lethal combat, you can have Gramps using bottles
filled with scented oil or some other substance that the
harpies loathe and causes them to fly away spitting curses
and shaking their feathers.
If this combat becomes lethal, the harpies will flee if two
or more of their comrades perish.

No matter how Tokko and Gramps interact with
the harpies, their arrival should feel like an
assistance, not a rescue. Although a quirky kid and
old man coming to save the day is fun in books
and films, most players still want to feel like the
heroes of their own story. So be cautious in this
interaction not to make the players feel less than.

Victory!
After the harpies are driven off, the kite-plane circles above
the adventurers as Tokko and Gramps wave down shouting
and cheering, eventually taking off in the direction of Sky
Kite Valley before an unfortunate and audible clacking can
be heard. Read the following text:

The delighted laughter and shouts of the
flying duo can be heard over their kite-planes
rhythmic hum as they circle above. The young
pilot tilts the aircraft's wings at a dramatic
angle, to better see you below. With an
exaggerated wave and brimming smile, he bids
you all farewell— straightening the plane once
more before taking off towards Sky Kite Valley.
It's at that moment that a resounding clank and
pop can be heard from the front of the plane.
This is shortly followed by a sudden plume of
smoke which begins to billow from the front of
the craft as they slowly begin to lose altitude.
Moments later, the once excited duo meets the
earth as their kite-plane sputters to a sad and
underwhelming halt.

352

After crashing their kite-plane Tokko and Gramps laugh it
off and quickly begin to prepare the craft to be dragged
back to the city. After officially meeting everyone, Gramps
asks the adventurers for some assistance getting the
kite-plane back to the city, with a promise of dinner for
their troubles.

Dinner Party
The dinner with Gramps, Tokko, and their family can be
whatever you envision. You can have Tokko’s family be a
large one with all kinds of quirky relatives or it could be
just Tokko and his grandfather. Either way, the goal of the
dinner party is to get the players attached to Tokko and
Gramps, as that will be what draws them into helping Tokko
when the kite-plane is stolen and crashed into the Shallows.
Possible dinner party topics of conversation include:
◊ The family is divided in their opinions about Rock Raley
and his efforts to fly to the Sky King (read “Sky Kite
Valley” in the Locations chapter). They would love to
know what the adventurers thoughts on Rock Raley are.
◊ The kite-plane is an innovative new design prototype that
Gramps and Tokko have built together. Gramps believes
the design might finally get Tokko on Rock Raley’s team
of aeronauts—a dream of Tokko’s. Gramps believes that
Tokko will be the one to solve the aerodynamics needed
to get Rock Raley’s team to the Sky King.
◊ One of the player characters could be challenged by
Tokko or a relative to cook a dish for the dinner party as a
friendly competition to see whose dish is the tastiest.

After the Party
After the dinner party, everyone's free to go about their
business and there’s some breathing room before the
adventure continues.
The adventurers can explore Sky Kite Valley and maybe
catch a jellyfish sighting, frequent one of the taverns, or go
on a mini quest. Meanwhile Tokko works on the kite-plane
with help from Gramps in hopes of winning Rock Raley’s
Top Kite Competition.

Crash of the Kite-Plane
When you’re ready to begin the second part of the adventure,
read the following:

It’s a bright and sunny day in the town of
Sky Kite when suddenly you see what looks like
Tokko's plane coming dangerously low across
the village, clipping one of the tall buildings as
it erratically swoops down the hillside toward
the ocean.
Tokko can be seen running down the hill,
chasing after the plane with his notes and
schematics flying everywhere as he begins to
wave his arms frantically and shout.
You can see what looks like a giant seahorse
spirit in the cockpit of the kite-plane. As the
plane goes overhead, the seahorse yells, “Sorry!
I didn’t want to do this!”

Even if the adventurers shoot or cast spells at the
kite-plane or its seahorse pilot, they can’t stop it from
careening out over the Shallows. Once it is clear that
nothing can be done, read the following:
Tokko finally arrives, gasping for air.
Villagers cluster around as everyone helplessly
watches the kite-plane get smaller and smaller
over the waves. Then, everyone lets out a gasp
and Tokko puts his hands to his head as the
kite-plane suddenly tilts and crash-lands into
the ocean with a splash.

Payment
If the party asks Tokko for money to recover the kite-plane,
he agrees, stating he has something very valuable he can
give them as a reward. The truth of the matter is, Tokko,
when put on the spot, panicked and promised something he
doesn’t have. So, despite his better judgment he steals a gold
statue of a sun panther from the Sun Panther temple near
Sky Kite. While the gold statue is worth far more than the
party is asking to recover the kite-plane, it is also an item
sacred to the Sun Panther druids—an order of shapeshifters near Sky Kite Valley. They will eventually track down
Tokko and then find whoever is holding their sacred item—
perhaps delivering a stern moral lesson in the process.

made their headquarters in a sunken First Age town and
are led by Bloodfin the Foul, a cunning fish folk captain
who sees the kite-plane as her way to get back into the
Lionfish King’s good graces as an offering of tribute.
All the while, Bloodfin is being swayed into deeper waters
of evil by a sea ha,g known as Slurpgill, who is urging her
protege to join forces with Venomous Rex. Slurpgill wishes
Bloodfin to fully embrace evil so she can turn Bloodfin into a
sea hag and build her coven. Slurpgill uses Bloodfin’s painful
past to manipulate her into leaving the Lionfish King.
Morris, the giant seahorse spirit that stole the kite-plane,
was intimidated into doing so by Bloodfin.

Preparing for the Mission
Tokko knows where the kite-plane went down, near a reef
at the far edge of the Shallows, a place where sailors say
that there’s a sunken town. No one goes there as it is notorious for snagging fishing lines and rumored to be a hideout
for fish folk pirates. Some even say it is haunted.
To get there, the party will need a boat, preferably a barge
large enough to recover the kite-plane. There are many
potential ways for the party to accomplish its mission.
As they are formulating their plan, keep the following
in mind:
◊ Dock workers and ship pilots will warn them of the
dangers of the Shallows—whirlpools, sea monsters,
hammer gulls, and fish folk pirates. Getting out to the
reef should feel dangerous.
◊ The party could also choose to hire a sea-glider out there
or a hot air balloon. To accomplish this, you could make
up a place like Old Jimbo’s Seaplane Shop or Belinda’s
Balloonery which could spawn a fun side quest or earn a
valuable (and possibly quirky) ally for future adventures
in Obojima. How they would then use those methods to
get the kite-plane back is up to their ingenuity.
◊ If they are not already familiar with the Mariners’ Guild,
the party should be made aware of them for access to
information and equipment (see “Holly and the Mariners’ Guild” below).

Whatever means the party chooses to get out
to the reef and the sunken town can be fraught
with peril. Monster attacks, natural dangers, or
a comically malfunctioning boat or plane can
turn up the drama.

Stealing from the Sun Panther temple could cost Tokko
his reputation and a chance at joining Rock Raley’s team if
word gets out about the theft.

Undersea Thieves
The fish folk who have taken Tokko’s kite-plane are a band
of exiles from the Lionfish King’s domain. The exiles have

353

Holly and the Coastal Divers’ Lodge
The Mariners’ Guild can help with underwater exploration providing information, equipment, potions, and other
magic items. You can have the characters meet and talk
with a Mariners’ Guild member in Sky Kite Valley.

Potion of Water Breathing
Uncommon, See page 235

You can also open a larger adventure by having the party
travel to the Northern Branch of the Mariners’ Guild to
meet Holly Clintock herself. There, they will learn about
her quest to rebuild the Pointue (see “Coastal Divers’ Lodge,
Northern Branch” in Locations) which can continue the
adventure after this one is completed.
Mariners’ Guild members are generally friendly and
helpful. They are of course operating on their love of the
ocean environment, boundless enthusiasm, and a shoestring budget. Any assistance is always greatly appreciated.
The Mariners’ Guild can offer:
◊ Diving Armor. This specialty diving suit is made from
a heavy metal as has been painstakingly crafted by the
divers lodge. While wearing divers armor your movement
is reduced by 10, unless your Strength score is equal to or
greater than 18. Additionally, whenever the spell Water
Breathing* is cast on you while wearing the divers armor,
the duration of the spell is doubled for you. There is only
one diving suit.
◊ Goatskin Balloons. These are balloon-like leather sacks,
made from a whole goatskin, that magically inflate. They
are mainly used for buoyancy in an emergency. As an
action, the user can pull the chord on the balloon, magically filling it with air and sending a character holding
the balloon rocketing towards the water's surface at a
speed of 100 ft. per round. There are as many goatskin
balloons as there are members of the mission.
◊ Fishfins. These are fish-like fins that an adventurer can
put on their hands and feet. When worn, fishfins grant
the wearer 40-foot movement while underwater. The
lodge only has 1 set of fishfins.
◊ Flarestones. When struck underwater, these little stones
sputter with a bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim
light for an additional 20 feet. Flarestones last for 15
minutes and the lodge can give up to 3 per adventurer.
Above water, they are normal stones.
◊ Enough potions of water breathing to give each character
1 potion.
◊ Diver’s Candy. A hard candy specially made by the
Mariners’ Guild that you can bite down on to release
a puff of air that gives an adventurer 1 turn of Water
Breathing*. Each character is given 1.

354

The Sunken Town
Once preparations are made, Tokko directs the party to
the reef where the kite-plane went down. Tokko is not a
sailor, so if they choose to go via boat, the party must hire a
captain or try to pilot the boat themselves.
The trip to the reef can be perilous or smooth sailing. But
once the party arrives, they can see a colorful reef wall
below the crystal clear waves that goes down 200 feet to a
white sand bottom. After a brief search over the reef, they
can see, far below, a bit of torn cloth caught on an outcropping of coral that Tokko recognizes as a piece of the fabric
cover of the kite-plane.
Once the adventurers go underwater and get to the
bottom of the reef, they can see in the distance, strange
outlines of the sunken town as well as a path leading from
their current location towards it.

Diving in the Shallows
The waters of the Shallows are magically clear allowing for
200-foot visibility before details begin to get fuzzy due to
particles floating in the water.
As adventurers dive beneath the waves, colors begin to
get lost, but the Shallows are magical and colors remain
longer due to their crystal clear waters.
Colors are lost in the following order:
◊ Red at 100 feet
◊ Orange at 150 feet
◊ Yellow at 200 feet
◊ Green at 300 feet
◊ Blue at 500 feet
Rarely are the Shallows deeper than 500 feet.

BUOYANCY
To sink in salt water, characters need to be counterweighted—usually a 20-pound sack of stones worn on the
belt. If they lose this counterweight during their journey
underwater, they will pop to the surface like a balloon at
a movement rate of 40 feet. Because characters are not
breathing compressed air, they will not suffer any ill effects
like the bends, but being highly buoyant can make for some
interesting (and difficult) situations.

SOUND
While words are not understandable underwater, sounds
are highly audible—especially metallic, buzzing, and sharp
clicking sounds—which travel through water at a much
higher speed than air. Because the ears of surface dwellers
are designed for an air environment, sounds made underwater are difficult to locate. This can create an unsettling
mood when a character hears a crunching or strange buzzing noise but can’t locate exactly where its origin is.

VISIBILITY
If a fight occurs on the seafloor or if a character thrashes
around at the bottom, you can choose to impair their visibility due to silt and sand being kicked up. After a round
of combat or if someone uses the dash action, or otherwise
disturbs the seafloor, a cloud of silt 15 feet in diameter is
created. Anyone within it suffers the blinded condition.
This area of poor visibility lasts for 1 minute after all movement has ceased.
If you choose to use this in your game, a character must
be at least 5 feet off the seafloor to not incur this effect.

CURRENTS
Generally, the waters of the Shallows are relatively calm,
but occasionally (if you want to throw in a bit of chaos)
there are strong currents that flow across the sea floor
powerful enough to blow a character over and send them
flying. When a current comes along, each player rolls a d6.
On a roll of 5 or 6, their character gets blown 30 feet in
a direction of your choice unless they succeed at a DC 13
Strength saving throw and hold on to something stationary.
If they are not anchored to the floor, loose objects
(such as a kite-plane) can get carried away in the current.

You can make the experience of being underwater
as much a part of your game as you want to.
Having players deal with the 3D environment,
ambient noises, potentially blinding silt, and other
underwater anomalies can either be a source of
fun or frustration. Make sure you have the kind of
players who enjoy these challenges and limitations
before putting them into play as they are all easily
removed due to “the magic of the Shallows”, which
can be the excuse for why being underwater here is
just about the same as being on land.

Exploring the Sunken Town
The sunken town is from the First Age and can therefore
be as magical as you need it to be to explain any anomalies or quirks of physics and reality. There might be weird
magic effects like an anti-magic zone where potions of water
breathing are nullified or areas that are perfectly dry and
free of water. It’s all your call.
You can also have the adventurers discover how this
place became submerged, plunging them into a deeper
mystery that leads to an adventure after this one.
Before the adventurers near the town, figure out what
direction they are approaching it from. Then describe what
they see as they move onto the map.
The following locations are keyed to the Map of the
Sunken Town.

1.

MAIN ROAD

Because it is a First Age site, the asphalt road shows little
sign of wear or erosion and is fairly clear of any encrustation by marine life like coral and barnacles. There are some
clusters of Knobble Leaf Seaweed growing through the
small cracks in the pavement that wave in the current and
can provide some cover for a small or tiny character but
mostly the main road is clear of debris.

2.

TRAIN CAR

This metal train car has a wood and fabric paneled interior
and can be entered through one of the small hatches in the
roof or through one of the windows or doors on the side of
the car. To allow the characters to enter silently, one of the
windows could be broken.
Inside the train cars are eerie rows of empty seats amid
waving clumps of Tangle Weed.
If you would like, the tracks and depot can also be a stop
for the Wandering Line (see “Wandering Line” in Locations).

3.

TRAIN DEPOT

This is a well-built wooden structure that has arrival and
departure times for the train still visible that are posted
within a glass-covered frame. Behind the ticket counter is
a large cluster of Witch’s Eye Coral. Underneath the coral
cluster is a tiny burrow that is home to a mischievous sea
sprite (use the elemental spirit stat block) companion
spirit named Sligo.

356

Sligo wants the pearl inside of the giant clam that lives in
area 9 (Bloodfin’s Lair). If Sligo is promised the pearl, it will
tell the party all it knows about the fish folk pirates
including some idea of the relationship between Bloodfin
and Slurpgill.
If you would like, Sligo can also give the party a ticket for the
Wandering Line that it keeps buried deep within its burrow.

4.

JOLLY CONE

This was once a First Age ice cream parlor that is now
home to 1d6+2 Blue-Back Salmon.
The stainless steel ice cream
machines are still here although
they no longer work and are
covered in Knobble Leaf Seaweed.
Inside the cash register are a
handful of Seashells.

Blue Back Salmon
Common, See page 201

5.

FISH FOLK HIDEOUT

In this large warehouse, there are 8 fish folk pirates who
are on alert, guarding the kite-plane while Bloodfin figures
out her plan of either presenting her prize to the Lionfish
King or taking it to Venomous Rex to spite her former king.
Bloodfin has a 25% chance of being here when the
characters investigate.
Up to 10 Fish Folk Teeth can be found here after a
10-minute search.

6.

MOXY’S MUSIC GROTTO

Moxy’s is an ancient First Age music store. Rows of racks
that once held vinyl albums, cassettes, and CDs line the
store. Hidden behind the counter is a Vinyl Record.

MORRIS
Swimming inside the music store is a giant sea horse spirit
(use the aquatic beast spirit stat block) named Morris, the
cowardly thief of the kite-plane. Morris is terrified of Slurpgill and is doing his best to get through a dangerous partnership with her, which is why he felt compelled to steal the
kite-plane when asked by Bloodfin—her new favorite pet.
Although he is scared of Bloodfin, he is even more
terrified of Slurpgil, which is why he will remind Bloodfin
at times, “That’s not what Slurpgill would want” if he
senses that she might not bend to the sea hag’s will.
Because of his fears, he won’t hesitate to lie to or tattle on
the party to Bloodfin to survive.

7.

KAT’S ISLAND KITCHEN

This was a First Age cafe. There’s a few tables for customers,
a counter where the food was ordered and a small kitchen
with all the utensils, cookware, chef’s tools, and cafe items.
A series of thumping sounds can be heard coming from
inside the oven. The window to see the inside of the oven
is obscured by a layer of soot. If anyone opens the oven
door, a blowbelly pufferfish (see stat block below) bursts
out in a jump scare moment.

8.

JERRY’S GARAGE

This is a First Age garage with all the tools still intact. There
are wrenches, a mechanical car jack, oil cans, grease guns,
and gauges. There’s an old kei truck and 2 mopeds here.

8A.

TOOLSHED

This is a First Age tool shed that still has a wide assortment of
spanners and ratchets, but it is now a lair for 4 giant crabs*.

9.

BLOODFIN’S LAIR

Bloodfin’s Lair is actually an old Goodie Mart—a First Age
chain of markets. This Goodie Mart is now the private lair
of Bloodfin the Foul (use the merrow* stat block) who
has removed all of the usual things that one would find
in a mini market and has decorated it in what can only be
described as “gothic deepsea chic”.
Among the decorative ribbons of Tangle Weed, skeletons
of sea creatures, garlands of Oporion Glass, Seashells and
sea urchins, Bloodfin has a giant clam that has a 500gp
pearl inside of it. The clam can be opened with a successful
DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. Also in the giant clam is a
large cluster of giant octopus eggs that belong to the giant
octopus, Lucinda (see area 10a. “Giant Octopus Den” below).

10.

BORISSS’ LAIR

Borisss is a sea snake spirit (use the giant constrictor
snake* stat block but with an INT of 10) who is fiercely
loyal to Bloodfin. He is currently coiled up around his
favorite teddy bear that he found when Bloodfin’s gang first
came to the sunken town.
There is nothing of value here.

10A.

GIANT OCTOPUS DEN

In this little shack is a sad Awakened Giant Octopus (use
the giant octopus* stat block but with an INT of 10)
named Lucinda. Lucinda is a gentle creature, but Bloodfin
is holding her eggs hostage and is forcing Lucinda to be
her junkyard dog. Lucinda doesn’t know her own strength,
but she fears both Bloodfin and Slurpgill and can’t figure
out a way to get her eggs back.

11.

TRAIN STATION STORAGE LOCKERS

This building contains rows of storage lockers, many of
which are open but there are a few that are still locked
(DC 20 Dexterity check to unlock).
Inside one of the storage lockers is an indestructible
suitcase covered in coral. To open the suitcase
requires a successful DC 25 Dexterity check to
open the magic lock. If it is opened, inside is a
Neko Ronin figurine in its original
packaging. The interior of the suitcase
has been magically kept dry, but
if opened underwater, the
enchantment is broken and the
pristine contents are soaked.

Using Monsters to Avert Mayhem

Common Enemy

At any time during the exploration, you can choose to use
monsters to create tension, chaos, or an uneasy alliance,
especially if you want your adventure to be more of a roleplaying experience than a combat experience.

If a fight breaks out between the adventures and the fish
folk and you wish to give the adventures another opportunity to make amends through conversation. We recommend
introducing two seaweed elementals at the beginning
of the second round of combat with Bloodfin and the fish
folk. Bloodfin and her gang may be villains, but they’re not
dummies, and when faced with the threat of the elementals, they can be reasoned with and perhaps even become
allies, if just for a moment.

◊ The blowbelly pufferfish (see below) can act like a ticking time bomb or a laser motion sensor that can go off if
a character makes one wrong move, causing all kinds of
interesting situations. It can also be used against enemies
if used carefully.
◊ A school of frenzied giant sharks* can also be used as a
surprise threat.
◊ Seaweed elementals can be introduced as a deadly and
common enemy to create an alliance between the party
and Bloodfin’s gang.

Pirates
No matter which direction they approach from or how many
buildings they explore, the adventurers will eventually need
to face the fish folk guarding the kite-plane. This conflict can
be solved through clever roleplay and bargaining or combat.
As the party deals with the fish folk in the sunken town,
keep the following in mind:
◊ If an adventurer rolls a natural 20 in combat against a
fish folk, they knock out a fish folk tooth—an item which
can be used to make potions.
◊ Fish folk are always on the lookout for a Nakudama princess of royal bearing who the Lionfish King is so eager to
marry. (For more details, read “Domain of the Lionfish
King - Royal Aspirations” in the Locations section).
◊ If one fish folk is alerted, an alarm is sounded (banging a
tin can), and the other pirates in the gang come running.
◊ Fish folk will flee when there are 3 or less of them left.
◊ Bloodfin the Foul may barter for the glider. Keep in mind
her objective which is to either rejoin the Lionfish King
or betray her former king and join with his archrival,
Venomous Rex, which will please her evil mentor, Slurpgill. Bloodfin will start with unreasonable demands for
the kite-plane. Here are a few ideas:
• Wanting Holly Clintock as a captive in exchange for
the kite-plane.
• Destroy the new Pointue and bring back a trophy for
proof of its destruction.
• Destroy the Mariners’ Guild Northern headquarters.

Slurpgill
Slurpgill is a sea hag who is attempting to start her own coven.
For that, she needs two other hags and Slurpgill believes that
Bloodfin will make a fine hag with the proper training; her
anger and exiled status are perfect tools for manipulation and
drawing her deeper into the hag’s evil clutches.
All the water spirits tremble when they hear Slurpgill’s
name, and her reputation even extends to the witch covens
on land. While Slurpgill doesn’t make a physical appearance
in this adventure, the threat of her power and influence is
felt by all the NPCs that the party interact with in the
sunken town. Slurpgill, like Venomous Rex, is designed to
be an underwater nemesis who can plague the party
throughout their adventures on Obojima. Where Slurpgill’s
lair is, is up to you.
The more you play up the NPCs fear of Slurpgill and have
them tell stories of her wickedness, the more effective and
fun she becomes as a villain in your story. A great villain
makes great heroes.

Wrapping it All Up
Once the adventures have finally obtained the kite-plane,
they’ll have to get creative to remove the craft from the
seafloor. We recommend rewarding creativity here, but if
necessary, Tokko can give a gentle nudge to use any remaining goatskin balloons to help surface the sunken kite-plane.
If needed, he may even have one or two on the ship he can
offer to the party.
Once Tokko returns, he fesses up to Gramps and explains
what has happened. Rather than being angry, Gramps is
incredibly grateful that Tokko is safe and will turn to
embrace the party. Gramps, in Tokko’s absence, has been
worried sick about the grandson. When he saw the kiteplane missing and Tokko along with it, he feared the worst.
So with their return, a huge relief washes over him and he
begins to shed tears of joy.
With the kite-plane returned, along with Tokko, the
adventurers have made friends for life and if you choose,
the story can continue. Tokko and Gramps have a lot of
work ahead of them if they still plan to finish the kite-plane
and enter it into the Rock Raley aviation contest. This will
assuredly lead to numerous adventures and side quests.

Blowbelly Pufferfish
Blowbelly pufferfish are generally docile creatures but are
easily startled. If they feel threatened, they inflate instantly
to an enormous size. Anyone touching their prickly skin
can get injected with doses of toxins. When a blowbelly
pufferfish dies, they burst, sending a spray of poisonous
spines in all directions.
Blowbelly pufferfish are often found bobbing along coral
reefs and on the sandy bottom of the sea.

Death Burst. When the blowbelly pufferfish dies, it
bursts. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a
DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) piercing
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

Actions
Multiattack. The blowbelly pufferfish makes two
Chomp attacks.
Chomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. Hit: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage.
Puff Up (Recharge 5-6). The blowbelly pufferfish
inflates its size, becoming Huge and filling its space.
Each creature in its space is pushed to an unoccupied
space outside the area and must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
9 (2d8) poison damage and is Poisoned for 1 minute as
the barbs of the pufferfish poke and prod them. On a
successful save, the target takes half as much damage
and isn’t Poisoned. If the creature is pushed into a wall
or similar solid surface, it takes an extra 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and is Grappled (escape DC 13); until
this Grapple ends, the creature is also Restrained.
The blowbelly pufferfish stays puffed up until the start
of its next turn, after which it returns to its normal
size. While puffed up, it gains a +2 bonus to its AC.

ADVENTURE:
LOST WITHIN THE
CRAWLING CANOPY

T

“Lost Within The Crawling Canopy” is intended for 2 to 4 5th-level characters.

he adventurers have saved Miga, a dara novelist, and Goose, her beloved dog companion from a dangerous howler
attack, only to be surrounded and engulfed by the Crawling Canopy—a moving forest that roams the Gale Fields.
While in the forest, the party encounters a fearsome monstrosity—a crow-like abomination that captures their
newfound friend and melts into the forest. They must now save Miga from this unfortunate series of events and return
her beloved Goose to her.

Adventure Begins!

Inside The Canopy

While wandering in the Gale Fields, the adventurers hear
sounds of distress amid the cackling of howlers. If they
investigate, they see a lone dara named Miga (female dara,
commoner*) who is fending off 5 howler yippers.

Whether the adventurers woke up in the forest or were
overtaken by its crawling trees read the following:

On closer inspection, the adventurers can see that one
of the howlers is holding a small dog, which is yapping
and writhing in the hands of the cackling creature. This is
Miga’s beloved pup, Goose, which the howlers have taken
from poor Miga and who she is desperately trying to get
back from them.
When the adventurers arrive, the howlers stay for no
longer than one round, after which they attempt to flee
with Goose in hand. Miga will run after them and ask for
assistance getting her dog back.

After the Conflict
After the encounter, Miga will rejoice as she reconnects
with Goose. She will thank the adventurers and return to
where the fight took place to pick up her scattered papers
and books. Miga tells the party that she is wandering
Obojima looking for glyphs from other dara and writing a
novel about her adventures.
It's at this point that she exclaims how exciting this chapter will be in her book and how she desperately needs to
know more about the beloved heroes who came to her and
Goose’s aid. She'll then ask that the party join her for a meal
and share a camp with her for just one night, after which
she will leave them to continue their journey without her.
Miga’s personality is quite bubbly and excited. She’s quite
young for a dara at the age of 17 and is overly interested in
learning about life outside of Roa Kala (see page 94 to learn
more about Roa Kala).

The trunks and treetops of the forest
that now surrounds you gently sway in all
directions—their bulbous roots curling above
ground like a corkscrew drilling into the soil.
Pillars of light pierce through the canopy above,
before suddenly disappearing as the ground
begins to rumble and shake. In the distance,
you watch as a copse of trees uproot themselves,
shifting and trading places, before planting
their roots once more.

While inside the Crawling Canopy, the forest is constantly
moving and changing. (To learn more about this magical
location see page 78)

Flying Characters
At this level, it would be quite uncommon for the party to
have the ability to give all characters flight to escape. If one
or more characters try to fly away, you can describe that the
forest stretches for miles in each direction, making it an
arduous task to attempt to lead the party out of the forest,
especially as it's constantly shifting and changing.

Other Adventures in the
Crawling Canopy

Engulfed by the Crawling Canopy

Now that the adventurers are thoroughly stuck, you can
choose to extend the story by having the party encounter
a number of mysteries, characters, and odd magics. These
encounters can grow the adventurers’ understanding of the
forest, plant seeds for future adventures, or give breathing
space until the next plot point.

During camp, like the ocean crashing around a stone, the
Crawling Canopy surrounds the party after they’ve been
lulled to sleep by the sweet scent of spinning Windbloom.

Use any of the NPCs or Notable Locations in the Crawling Canopy section of this book. You can also use any of
the following:

If someone is on watch, they hear the forest coming
in the darkness, the rustling of leaves and branches, the
groaning of wood, and the shaking of the earth, all growing
in intensity as the forest encroaches and encircles the party.

Overgrown Caravan

If they try to make a run for freedom, it makes no difference. No matter what direction the party sets off in, they
encounter a wall of trees. The forest is miles wide.

What Miga Knows
Miga has heard rumors about the Crawling Canopy. How
much she knows is up to you, but at a minimum, she tells
the party that the Crawling Canopy shifts and changes, and
the unlucky are trapped in it for a lifetime.

The adventurers discover a caravan of three wagons, overgrown with roots and vines; their once bright colors now
faded. The wagons are intact, though their wooden wheels
are fused with the forest floor by roots.
With an Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 14, the
adventurers will find Lover’s Vine, Peeping Willow, and
Essence of Glumbug stashed away inside the wagons.
Among some rotting ledgers and inventory lists, there
is a journal that tells the tale of a group of merchants who
entered the Crawling Canopy lured by tales of rare herbs,
only to become hopelessly lost as the forest shifted around
them. The journal ends abruptly.

Flying Squirrels

Wandering Monsters

These curious forest creatures follow the party from high in the
canopy and eat any fruit, bread crumbs, or nuts left behind.

Anytime you feel your players need an encounter or a
combat as they are exploring the forest, feel free to choose
one of these monsters.

Breath of the Forest
Every so often, the forest pauses, and a cool breeze blows
through the trees which all sway in unison as if breathing
one great breath.

Echo of the Canopy
Every now and then, the party may hear distorted echoes of
their own voices. It could be a conversation that they had
or a version of it. They could also hear premonitions, their
voices bordering on panic at being lost forever or their voices
could carry a warning of a monster that is hunting them.

Senmo the Corvid

The Search

When you are ready, the adventurers encounter Senmo, an
old and delusional crowlike creature who’s called the crawling canopy its home for over 70 years.

If the adventurers decide to give chase, they’ll be thrust into
a paced sprint where they’ll need to navigate the changing environment while keeping track of the beast they’re
hunting. As you describe the shifting trees and adventurer’s
efforts to find Miga and Senmo, have each player roll two
skill checks (one Survival and one Acrobatics). If the sum
of a player's two skill checks is less than 25, their character
suddenly falls behind and is left out of the chase.

Read the following:
You walk in an area darkened by thick
clusters of trees when you catch wind of a
sickening stench wafting on the breeze. The
same zephyr sends a chill up your body, as the
ambient sounds of the forest animals suddenly
grow louder and louder—the croaking of frogs
and buzzing of insects now burning your ears
with their intensity.
Then, as if switched off like some ancient
machine, the air goes silent, and from the
distance, you hear a hollow clacking that
echoes across the forest floor.

Each player must make this dual skill check 3 times before
Senmo eventually escapes with Miga. If any of the players
are able to succeed in all 3 of these skill checks, they are
rewarded with a trinket that will aid them in their search for
Miga. While running, Senmo accidentally slams into one of
the moving trees, knocking loose one of his black feathers.

Meeting the Sheep

A rasping voice then hisses, “I smell you, Dara.”

Whether it is directly after the abduction or during a wrong
turn while chasing Senmo, the adventurers will eventually
stumble on a curious sheep creature who’s taking a break
on a downed tree.

Senmo was made from Malgrotha’s torn flesh and is a
distorted copy or “child” of the imprisoned creature. (see
more on Malgarotha and the origin of the Crawling Canopy
on page 340)

Mr. Sheep can be found wandering all over Obojima
and the Spirit Realm and is known by many names—Lord
Dengu, Ram-Ram, Omen, Din-Poko, and many more, but he
is fine with being called Mr. Sheep. Some say he is an elder
spirit while others say he’s something far beyond that, but
no one knows for sure.

Since Senmo’s creation, it's been wandering the forest
searching for the dara that imprisoned Malgrotha all those
years ago. It too is bound to the confines and the Crawling
Canopy, and after 70 years of searching for dara, has begun
to lose its mind.
Even in its confused and altered state, it still recognizes
its goal. So when it saw Miga it was quick to act. Its tactic is
to rush in, grab Miga, and run off into the forest and back
to its lair, allowing the constantly shifting forest to cover its
tracks behind it.
If one of the party members is a dara, Senmo might hiss
in a panic, unsure which dara to grab, before eventually
deciding to take Miga. While acting out its actions, it might
shout “Which one!?! Which one!?! Which ONE!?!”
In this encounter, Senmo wants to capture its prey and
flee. The moment it has successfully grappled Miga, it will
dash away as quickly as it can, using its abilities to slow and
distract the party when necessary.

Attack of Opportunity
To make Senmo feel even more cunning, you could have it
attack the party during an encounter from the Wandering
Monster Table from the previous page.

Mr. Sheep is usually accompanied by a host of mice that
walk on their hind legs and chatter in nonsensical language.
There are always as many mice as there are lit candles in
Mr. Sheep’s magic lantern as the mice are people who have
broken deals they have made with him.

Deals with the Sheep
Mr. Sheep has a bubbly and curious personality. When he
speaks, he does so with odd phrasing and misused words.
Though no matter how confusing he might be, he never
seems to be confused himself, as he always seems to have
the answer for everything.
When the adventurers first stumble upon him he seems
quite intrigued and immediately offers the party a seat at
his table, the fallen tree he’s laid a small pile of crackers on.
It's here, in this moment, that he’ll poke and prod in his
disarming way to uncover what the party desires—eventually offering to make a deal with them.
Though Mr. Sheep is known to make simple deals, especially for his favorite food—goat cheese, he’s also known
to ask for more cryptic items such as “the color green” or
“the sound of birds”. Should a character make a deal with
Mr. Sheep, he, more often than not, has the magic ability
to deliver on that deal, resulting in the character losing the
ability to see the color green or hear birdsong for example.
This deal can be permanent or temporary.

363

Should a character make a deal with Mr. Sheep to help
find Miga, he explains that he knows how to find a sage,
who in return can lead them to the Senmo’s lair. What the
players don’t know is that the Sage is being held by the
Sheep as one of his mouse followers (see “The Mice” below).
Breaking a Deal. Should a character attempt to break a
deal, a curious thing happens. Mr. Sheep gives one warning.
If Mr. Sheep is not around, this warning can come telepathically or in a dream. If the warning is not heeded, he
lights one of its candles, and the character is turned into
a mouse—thereafter following him on his merry journey
until their debt is paid.

Roleplaying The Sheep
Mr. Sheep never expresses any negative emotions, strolling
through danger and rarely showing alarm or distress. He
instead finds most things amusing and treats them as playthings. Though he is often curious and nosey, he’s just as
likely to lose interest in or outright ignore things he doesn’t
care about. Beyond his seemingly endless array of known
magics, he also seems to be completely invulnerable, able to
consume anything, and immune to spells that attempt to
make him reveal the truth, change form, charm, or try to
read his mind.
There is no stat block for the Sheep as he is not meant for
combat and will simply disappear if attacked.

The Mice
The mice are all cursed, deal breakers who are serving out
their sentences, and they are all wary of Mr. Sheep’s uncanny
power. Every now and then, one of the mice may try to sneak
a hand gesture to get a party member’s attention, but the
Sheep shoots them a stern look and they go back to behaving. The Sheep doesn’t reveal the true nature of the mice and
if asked, says that they just follow him, but because they are
mischievous, he has to keep an eye on them.
The Sage is one of these deal breakers who is now a
mouse in the Sheep’s entourage.

GET LOST, SHEEP!
If the party chooses to not deal with the Sheep, then after
the encounter, the Sage (in his mouse form) finds the party
and gestures for them to follow him (the Sage in mouse
form can’t speak Common but can understand it). If the
party follows him to his hut, and assists in bringing him
one of his old potions, he’ll drink it to restore his form and
will answer their questions.

The Sage
The Sage was a powerful witch who lived within the Crawling Canopy. One hundred and fifty years ago, he broke a
deal with the Sheep and ever since then he has been one of
the mice, cursed to follow the Sheep. The Sage can’t remember what the deal was that he broke, he has been a mouse

364

for so long that many of his memories have vanished only
to be replaced by a burgeoning desire for cheese and a
furtive fear of predators.

The Sage’s Hut
Whether Mr. Sheep takes the adventurers or they are led
by the Sage in mouse form, they arrive at an old abandoned
hut in the woods. The inside of the hut is covered in dust,
and is now home to an array of forest critters.
Once the Sage is inside, either the Sheep releases him and
then vanishes or the Sage asks the party through charades
to fetch a dusty potion from a locked cabinet (DC 14), after
which he drinks it and is restored to his human form.
Grateful for being saved, the Sage agrees to help the party
by giving them an ornate box with a golden beetle inside.
Once released from its box, the golden beetle will fly away
leaving a trail of glowing light—a path of the shortest
distance to the edge of the Crawling Canopy. The golden
trail vanishes in 1 minute, so the Sage warns to only release
the beetle when they are ready to leave.
The Sage also gives them a bottle with a piglet spirit
inside of it. This piglet spirit can sniff out the Senmo and
lead the party to its lair and their friend, Miga.

Showdown!
As the party nears the lair of the lair of Senmo, read
the following:

Again, a sickening stench assaults the senses
as you near the monster’s lair. The trees get
thicker and more twisted until they are no
longer trees but a slick, snarl of thick roots,
trunks, and interwoven vines that create a
massive, squirming nest. Locked within knotted
roots are the carcasses of rusted and crushed
cars, mashed and bent from the pressure of the
squirming trees.
You can hear an unearthly muttering coming
from within the tangled structure. “You will
free us or you will die, dara.”

If one of the adventurers was able to procure one of
Senmo’s feathers, then the party is able to sneak up on
Senmo without it noticing.
In the crushed bed of an old truck is Miga, she looks up
in distress and Senmo paces beside the vehicle berating her,
hoping to obtain some information on the magic that binds
it to the forest.
Its attention is on Miga unless it senses any invaders in
its domain. If it does, it attacks.

Non Combat Option
Although it's likely to end in some conflict, Senmo can be
reasoned with. It has begun to lose some of its better judgment, and so a clever or conniving character might be able
to outwit the creature or convince it to let Miga go.

MONSTERS
Here is what can be found in the Crawling Canopy:

Senmo (The Child of Malgrotha)
Every now and then, Malgrotha tears at its own body in
mindless rage, rending off a piece of its own flesh. This
flesh then wriggles and grows, sprouting limbs and talons
of its own as it struggles to its feet and lurches off into the
forest to hunt. These are the Children of Malgrotha, and
they tirelessly search the forest for their mother. They
believe that every dara is the First Dara—the being that
imprisoned their mother in the Crawling Canopy and who
has the key to releasing them from this moving prison.
